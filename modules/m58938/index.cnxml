<title>Malaria</title>
<para id="fs-id1167661308461">Despite more than a century of intense research and clinical advancements, <term id="term-00001">malaria</term> remains one of the most important infectious diseases in the world today. Its widespread distribution places more than half of the world’s population in jeopardy. In 2015, the WHO estimated there were about 214 million cases of malaria worldwide, resulting in about 438,000 deaths; about 88% of cases and 91% of deaths occurred in Africa.<footnote id="fs-id1167661554108">World Health Organization. “World Malaria Report 2015: Summary.” 2015. http://www.who.int/malaria/publications/world-malaria-report-2015/report/en/. Accessed July 28, 2016.</footnote> Although malaria is not currently a major threat in the US, the possibility of its reintroduction is a concern. Malaria is caused by several protozoan parasites in the genus <term class="no-emphasis" id="term-00002"><emphasis effect="italics">Plasmodium</emphasis></term>: <emphasis effect="italics">P. falciparum, P. knowlesi, P. malariae, P. ovale,</emphasis> and <emphasis effect="italics">P. vivax. Plasmodium</emphasis> primarily infect red blood cells and are transmitted through the bite of <term class="no-emphasis" id="term-00003"><emphasis effect="italics">Anopheles</emphasis> mosquito</term>es.</para>
<para id="fs-id1167663485454">Currently, <emphasis effect="italics">P. falciparum</emphasis> is the most common and most lethal cause of malaria, often called falciparum malaria. Falciparum malaria is widespread in highly populated regions of Africa and Asia, putting many people at risk for the most severe form of the disease.</para>
<para id="fs-id1167661433870">The classic signs and symptoms of malaria are cycles of extreme fever and chills. The sudden, violent symptoms of malaria start with malaise, abrupt chills, and fever (39–41° C [102.2–105.8 °F]), rapid and faint pulse, polyuria, headache, myalgia, nausea, and vomiting. After 2 to 6 hours of these symptoms, the fever falls, and profuse sweating occurs for 2 to 3 hours, followed by extreme fatigue. These symptoms are a result of <emphasis effect="italics">Plasmodium</emphasis> emerging from red blood cells synchronously, leading to simultaneous rupture of a large number of red blood cells, resulting in damage to the spleen, liver, lymph nodes, and bone marrow. The organ damage resulting from hemolysis causes patients to develop sludge blood (i.e., blood in which the red blood cells agglutinate into clumps) that can lead to lack of oxygen, necrosis of blood vessels, organ failure, and death.</para>
<para id="fs-id1167663640866">In established infections, malarial cycles of fever and chills typically occur every 2 days in the disease described as <term class="no-emphasis" id="term-00004">tertian malaria</term>, which is caused by <emphasis effect="italics">P. vivax</emphasis> and <emphasis effect="italics">P. ovale</emphasis>. The cycles occur every 3 days in the disease described as <term class="no-emphasis" id="term-00005">quartan malaria</term>, which is caused by <emphasis effect="italics">P. malariae</emphasis>. These intervals may vary among cases.</para>
<para id="fs-id1167663500953"><emphasis effect="italics">Plasmodium</emphasis> has a complex life cycle that includes several developmental stages alternately produced in mosquitoes and humans (<link target-id="OSC_Microbio_25_04_Malaria"/>). When an infected mosquito takes a blood meal, sporozoites in the mosquito salivary gland are injected into the host’s blood. These parasites circulate to the liver, where they develop into schizonts. The schizonts then undergo <term class="no-emphasis" id="term-00006">schizogony</term>, resulting in the release of many merozoites at once. The merozoites move to the bloodstream and infect red blood cells. Inside red blood cells, merozoites develop into trophozoites that produce more merozoites. The synchronous release of merozoites from red blood cells in the evening leads to the symptoms of malaria.</para>
<para id="fs-id1167663993328">In addition, some trophozoites alternatively develop into male and female gametocytes. The gametocytes are taken up when the mosquito takes a blood meal from an infected individual. Sexual sporogony occurs in the gut of the mosquito. The gametocytes fuse to form zygotes in the insect gut. The zygotes become motile and elongate into an ookinete. This form penetrates the midgut wall and develops into an oocyst. Finally, the oocyst releases new sporozoites that migrate to the mosquito salivary glands to complete the life cycle.</para>
<para id="fs-id1167661281271">Diagnosis of malaria is by microscopic observation of developmental forms of <emphasis effect="italics">Plasmodium</emphasis> in blood smears and rapid EIA assays that detect <emphasis effect="italics">Plasmodium</emphasis> antigens or enzymes (<link target-id="OSC_Microbio_25_04_BloodSmear"/>). Drugs such as <term class="no-emphasis" id="term-00007">chloroquine</term>, <term class="no-emphasis" id="term-00008">atovaquone</term> , <term class="no-emphasis" id="term-00009">artemether</term>, and <term class="no-emphasis" id="term-00010">lumefantrine</term> may be prescribed for both acute and prophylactic therapy, although some <emphasis effect="italics">Plasmodium</emphasis> spp. have shown resistance to antimalarial drugs. Use of insecticides and insecticide-treated bed nets can limit the spread of malaria. Despite efforts to develop a vaccine for malaria, none is currently available.</para>

<title>Toxoplasmosis</title>
<para id="fs-id1167663965041">The disease <term id="term-00012">toxoplasmosis</term> is caused by the protozoan <term class="no-emphasis" id="term-00013"><emphasis effect="italics">Toxoplasma gondii</emphasis></term>. <emphasis effect="italics">T. gondii</emphasis> is found in a wide variety of birds and mammals,<footnote id="fs-id1167661343937">A.M. Tenter et al.. “<emphasis effect="italics">Toxoplasma gondii</emphasis>: From Animals to Humans.” <emphasis effect="italics">International Journal for Parasitology</emphasis> 30 no. 12-13 (2000):1217–1258.</footnote> and human infections are common. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) estimates that 22.5% of the population 12 years and older has been infected with <emphasis effect="italics">T. gondii</emphasis>; but immunocompetent individuals are typically asymptomatic, however.<footnote id="fs-id1167661294514">Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. “Parasites - Toxoplasmosis (Toxoplasma Infection). Epidemiology &amp; Risk Factors.” 2015 http://www.cdc.gov/parasites/toxoplasmosis/epi.html. Accessed July 28, 2016.</footnote> Domestic cats are the only known definitive hosts for the sexual stages of <emphasis effect="italics">T. gondii</emphasis> and, thus, are the main reservoirs of infection. Infected cats shed <emphasis effect="italics">T. gondii</emphasis> oocysts in their feces, and these oocysts typically spread to humans through contact with fecal matter on cats’ bodies, in litter boxes, or in garden beds where outdoor cats defecate.</para>
<para id="fs-id1167663668984"><emphasis effect="italics">T. gondii</emphasis> has a complex <term class="no-emphasis" id="term-00014">life cycle</term> that involves multiple hosts. The <emphasis effect="italics">T. gondii</emphasis> life cycle begins when unsporulated oocysts are shed in the cat’s feces. These oocysts take 1–5 days to sporulate in the environment and become infective. Intermediate hosts in nature include birds and rodents, which become infected after ingesting soil, water, or plant material contaminated with the infective oocysts. Once ingested<emphasis effect="italics">,</emphasis> the oocysts transform into tachyzoites that localize in the bird or rodent neural and muscle tissue, where they develop into tissue cysts. Cats may become infected after consuming birds and rodents harboring tissue cysts. Cats and other animals may also become infected directly by ingestion of sporulated oocysts in the environment. Interestingly, <emphasis effect="italics">Toxoplasma</emphasis> infection appears to be able to modify the host’s behavior. Mice infected by <emphasis effect="italics">Toxoplasma</emphasis> lose their fear of cat pheromones. As a result, they become easier prey for cats, facilitating the transmission of the parasite to the cat definitive host<footnote id="fs-id1167661288469">J. Flegr. “Effects of <emphasis effect="italics">Toxoplasma</emphasis> on Human Behavior.” <emphasis effect="italics">Schizophrenia Bulletin</emphasis> 33, no. 3 (2007):757–760.</footnote> (<link target-id="OSC_Microbio_25_04_Toxoplasma"/>).</para>
<para id="fs-id1167663968854"><emphasis effect="italics">Toxoplasma</emphasis> infections in humans are extremely common, but most infected people are asymptomatic or have subclinical symptoms. Some studies suggest that the parasite may be able to influence the personality and psychomotor performance of infected humans, similar to the way it modifies behavior in other mammals.<footnote id="fs-id1167663963423">Ibid</footnote> When symptoms do occur, they tend to be mild and similar to those of mononucleosis. However, asymptomatic toxoplasmosis can become problematic in certain situations. Cysts can lodge in a variety of human tissues and lie dormant for years. Reactivation of these quiescent infections can occur in immunocompromised patients following transplantation, cancer therapy, or the development of an immune disorder such as <term class="no-emphasis" id="term-00015">AIDS</term>. In patients with AIDS who have toxoplasmosis, the immune system cannot combat the growth of <emphasis effect="italics">T. gondii</emphasis> in body tissues; as a result, these cysts can cause encephalitis, retinitis, pneumonitis, cognitive disorders, and seizures that can eventually be fatal.</para>
<para id="fs-id1167663735577">Toxoplasmosis can also pose a risk during <term class="no-emphasis" id="term-00016">pregnancy</term> because tachyzoites can cross the placenta and cause serious infections in the developing fetus. The extent of fetal damage resulting from toxoplasmosis depends on the severity of maternal disease, the damage to the placenta, the gestational age of the fetus when infected, and the virulence of the organism. Congenital toxoplasmosis often leads to fetal loss or premature birth and can result in damage to the central nervous system, manifesting as mental retardation, deafness, or blindness. Consequently, pregnant people are advised by the CDC to take particular care in preparing meat, gardening, and caring for pet cats.<footnote id="fs-id1167664000173">Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. “Parasites - Toxoplasmosis (Toxoplasma infection). Toxoplasmosis Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs).” 2013. http://www.cdc.gov/parasites/toxoplasmosis/gen_info/faqs.html. Accessed July 28, 2016.</footnote> Diagnosis of toxoplasmosis infection during pregnancy is usually achieved by serology including <term class="no-emphasis" id="term-00017">TORCH</term> testing (the “T” in TORCH stands for toxoplasmosis). Diagnosis of congenital infections can also be achieved by detecting <emphasis effect="italics">T. gondii</emphasis> DNA in amniotic fluid, using molecular methods such as PCR.</para>
<para id="fs-id1167663651194">In adults, diagnosis of toxoplasmosis can include observation of tissue cysts in tissue specimens. Tissue cysts may be observed in Giemsa- or Wright-stained biopsy specimens, and CT, magnetic resonance imaging, and lumbar puncture can also be used to confirm infection (<link target-id="OSC_Microbio_25_04_SabinFeld"/>).</para>
<para id="fs-id1167661431631">Preventing infection is the best first-line defense against toxoplasmosis. Preventive measures include washing hands thoroughly after handling raw meat, soil, or cat litter, and avoiding consumption of vegetables possibly contaminated with cat feces. All meat should be cooked to an internal temperature of 73.9–76.7 °C (165–170 °F).</para>
<para id="fs-id1167663741768">Most immunocompetent patients do not require clinical intervention for <emphasis effect="italics">Toxoplasma</emphasis> infections. However, neonates, pregnant people, and immunocompromised patients can be treated with <term class="no-emphasis" id="term-00018">pyrimethamine</term> and <term class="no-emphasis" id="term-00019">sulfadiazine</term>—except during the first trimester of pregnancy, because these drugs can cause birth defects. <term class="no-emphasis" id="term-00020">Spiramycin</term> has been used safely to reduce transmission in pregnant people with primary infection during the first trimester because it does not cross the placenta.</para>

<title>Chagas Disease</title>
<para id="fs-id1167663641829">Also called <term class="no-emphasis" id="term-00028">American trypanosomiasis</term>, Chagas disease is a zoonosis classified as a <term class="no-emphasis" id="term-00029">neglected tropical disease</term> (NTD). It is caused by the flagellated protozoan <term class="no-emphasis" id="term-00030"><emphasis effect="italics">Trypanosoma cruzi</emphasis></term> and is most commonly transmitted to animals and people through the feces of triatomine bugs. The <term class="no-emphasis" id="term-00031">triatomine bug</term> is nicknamed the kissing bug because it frequently bites humans on the face or around the eyes; the insect often defecates near the bite and the infected fecal matter may be rubbed into the bite wound by the bitten individual (<link target-id="OSC_Microbio_25_04_Trypanosom"/>). The bite itself is painless and, initially, many people show no signs of the disease. Alternative modes of transmission include contaminated blood transfusions, organ transplants from infected donors, and congenital transmission during pregnancy to a fetus.</para>
<para id="fs-id1167661280632">Chagas disease is endemic throughout much of Mexico, Central America, and South America, where, according to WHO, an estimated 6 million to 7 million people are infected.<footnote id="fs-id1167663655974">World Health Organization. “Chagas disease (American trypanosomiasis).

<para id="fs-id1167661561650">Triatomine bugs typically are active at night, when they take blood meals by biting the faces and lips of people or animals as they sleep and often defecate near the site of the bite. Infection occurs when the host rubs the feces into their eyes, mouth, the bite wound, or another break in the skin. The protozoan then enters the blood and invades tissues of the heart and central nervous system, as well as macrophages and monocytes. Nonhuman reservoirs of <emphasis effect="italics">T. cruzi</emphasis> parasites include wild animals and domesticated animals such as dogs and cats, which also act as reservoirs of the pathogen.<footnote id="fs-id1167663628038">C.E.

In addition, a localized nodule called a chagoma may form at the portal of entry, and swelling of the eyelids or the side of the face, called Romaña's sign, may occur near the bite wound. Symptoms of the acute phase may resolve spontaneously, but if untreated, the infection can persist in tissues, causing irreversible damage to the heart or brain. In rare cases, young children may die of <term class="no-emphasis" id="term-00032">myocarditis</term> or <term class="no-emphasis" id="term-00033">meningoencephalitis</term> during the acute phase of Chagas disease.</para>
<para id="fs-id1167661290717">Following the acute phase is a prolonged intermediate phase during which few or no parasites are found in the blood and most people are asymptomatic. Many patients will remain asymptomatic for life; however, decades after exposure, an estimated 20%–30% of infected people will develop chronic disease that can be debilitating and sometimes life threatening. In the chronic phase, patients may develop painful swelling of the colon, leading to severe twisting, constipation, and bowel obstruction; painful swelling of the esophagus, leading to dysphagia and malnutrition; and <term class="no-emphasis" id="term-00034">flaccid cardiomegaly</term> (enlargement of the heart), which can lead to heart failure and sudden death.</para>
<para id="fs-id1167663711841">Diagnosis can be confirmed through several different tests, including direct microscopic observation of trypanosomes in the blood, IFA, EIAs, PCR, and culturing in artificial media.

It is caused by approximately 20 different species of <term class="no-emphasis" id="term-00038"><emphasis effect="italics">Leishmania</emphasis></term>, protozoan parasites that are transmitted by <term class="no-emphasis" id="term-00039">sand fly</term> vectors such as <emphasis effect="italics">Phlebotomus</emphasis> spp. and <emphasis effect="italics">Lutzomyia</emphasis> spp. Dogs, cats, sheep, horses, cattle rodents, and humans can all serve as reservoirs.</para>
<para id="fs-id1167661353197">The <emphasis effect="italics">Leishmania</emphasis> protozoan is phagocytosed by macrophages but uses virulence factors to avoid destruction within the phagolysosome. The virulence factors inhibit the phagolysosome enzymes that would otherwise destroy the parasite. The parasite reproduces within the macrophage, lyses it, and the progeny infect new macrophages (see <link target-id="fs-id1172096177105" document="m58880">Micro Connections: When Phagocytosis Fails</link>).</para>
<para id="fs-id1167661291592">The three major clinical forms of leishmaniasis are cutaneous (oriental sore, Delhi boil, Aleppo boil), visceral (kala-azar, Dumdum fever), and mucosal (espundia). The most common form of disease is <term class="no-emphasis" id="term-00040">cutaneous leishmaniasis</term>, which is characterized by the formation of sores at the site of the insect bite that may start out as papules or nodules before becoming large ulcers (<link target-id="OSC_Microbio_25_04_Leishmania"/>).</para>
<para id="fs-id1167661456120">It may take <term class="no-emphasis" id="term-00041">visceral leishmaniasis</term> months and sometimes years to develop, leading to enlargement of the lymph nodes, liver, spleen, and bone marrow. The damage to these body sites triggers fever, weight loss, and swelling of the spleen and liver. It also causes a decrease in the number of red blood cells (anemia), white blood cells (leukopenia), and platelets (thrombocytopenia), causing the patient to become immunocompromised and more susceptible to fatal infections of the lungs and gastrointestinal tract.</para>
<para id="fs-id1167661325897">The mucosal form of leishmaniasis is one of the less common forms of the disease. It causes a lesion similar to the cutaneous form but <term class="no-emphasis" id="term-00042">mucosal leishmaniasis</term> is associated with mucous membranes of the mouth, nares, or pharynx, and can be destructive and disfiguring. Mucosal leishmaniasis occurs less frequently when the original cutaneous (skin) infection is promptly treated.</para>
<para id="fs-id1167661274177">Definitive diagnosis of leishmaniasis is made by visualizing organisms in Giemsa-stained smears, by isolating <emphasis effect="italics">Leishmania</emphasis> protozoans in cultures, or by PCR-based assays of aspirates from infected tissues. Specific DNA probes or analysis of cultured parasites can help to distinguish <emphasis effect="italics">Leishmania</emphasis> species that are causing simple cutaneous leishmaniasis from those capable of causing mucosal leishmaniasis.</para>
<para id="fs-id1167661759758">Cutaneous leishmaniasis is usually not treated. The lesions will resolve after weeks (or several months), but may result in scarring. Recurrence rates are low for this disease. More serious infections can be treated with <term class="no-emphasis" id="term-00043">stibogluconate</term> (antimony gluconate), <term class="no-emphasis" id="term-00044">amphotericin B</term>, and <term class="no-emphasis" id="term-00045">miltefosine</term>.</para>

<title>Schistosomiasis</title>
<para id="fs-id1167663608686">Schistosomiasis (bilharzia) is an NTD caused by blood flukes in the genus <term class="no-emphasis" id="term-00046"><emphasis effect="italics">Schistosoma</emphasis></term> that are native to the Caribbean, South America, Middle East, Asia, and Africa. Most human <term id="term-00047">schistosomiasis</term> cases are caused by <emphasis effect="italics">Schistosoma mansoni, S. haematobium</emphasis>, or <emphasis effect="italics">S. japonicum</emphasis>. <emphasis effect="italics">Schistosoma</emphasis> are the only <term class="no-emphasis" id="term-00048">trematodes</term> that invade through the skin; all other trematodes infect by ingestion. WHO estimates that at least 258 million people required preventive treatment for schistosomiasis in 2014.<footnote id="fs-id1167663485416">World Health Organization. “Schistosomiasis. Fact Sheet.” 2016. http://www.who.int/mediacentre/factsheets/fs115/en/. Accessed July 29, 2016.</footnote></para>
<para id="fs-id1167663621847">Infected human hosts shed <emphasis effect="italics">Schistosoma</emphasis> eggs in urine and feces, which can contaminate freshwater habitats of snails that serve as intermediate hosts. The eggs hatch in the water, releasing miracidia, an intermediate growth stage of the <emphasis effect="italics">Schistosoma</emphasis> that infect the snails. The miracidia mature and multiply inside the snails, transforming into cercariae that leave the snail and enter the water, where they can penetrate the skin of swimmers and bathers. The cercariae migrate through human tissue and enter the bloodstream, where they mature into adult male and female worms that mate and release fertilized eggs. The eggs travel through the bloodstream and penetrate various body sites, including the bladder or intestine, from which they are excreted in urine or stool to start the life cycle over again (<link target-id="OSC_Microbio_05_02_schistolLC" document="m58803"/>).</para>
<para id="fs-id1167663591240">A few days after infection, patients may develop a rash or itchy skin associated with the site of cercariae penetration. Within 1–2 months of infection, symptoms may develop, including fever, chills, cough, and myalgia, as eggs that are not excreted circulate through the body. After years of infection, the eggs become lodged in tissues and trigger inflammation and scarring that can damage the liver, central nervous system, intestine, spleen, lungs, and bladder. This may cause abdominal pain, enlargement of the liver, blood in the urine or stool, and problems passing urine. Increased risk for bladder cancer is also associated with chronic <emphasis effect="italics">Schistosoma</emphasis> infection. In addition, children who are repeatedly infected can develop malnutrition, anemia, and learning difficulties.</para>
<para id="fs-id1167663613278">Diagnosis of schistosomiasis is made by the microscopic observation of eggs in feces or urine, intestine or bladder tissue specimens, or serologic tests. The drug <term class="no-emphasis" id="term-00049">praziquantel</term> is effective for the treatment of all schistosome infections. Improving wastewater management and educating at-risk populations to limit exposure to contaminated water can help control the spread of the disease.</para>

<title>Cercarial Dermatitis</title>
<para id="fs-id1167663740606">The cercaria of some species of <emphasis effect="italics">Schistosoma</emphasis> can only transform into adult worms and complete their life cycle in animal hosts such as migratory birds and mammals. The cercaria of these worms are still capable of penetrating human skin, but they are unable to establish a productive infection in human tissue. Still, the presence of the cercaria in small blood vessels triggers an immune response, resulting in itchy raised bumps called <term id="term-00050">cercarial dermatitis</term> (also known as swimmer’s itch or clam digger's itch). Although it is uncomfortable, cercarial dermatitis is typically self-limiting and rarely serious. Antihistamines and antipruritics can be used to limit inflammation and itching, respectively.</para>
