<para id="fs-id1167662615957">Sam, a college freshman with a bad habit of oversleeping, nicked himself shaving in a rush to get to class on time. At the time, he didn’t think twice about it. But two days later, he noticed the cut was surrounded by a reddish area of skin that was warm to the touch. When the wound started oozing pus, he decided he had better stop by the university’s clinic. The doctor took a sample from the lesion and then cleaned the area.</para>

<para id="fs-id1167662442026">Human skin is an important part of the innate immune system. In addition to serving a wide range of other functions, the skin serves as an important barrier to microbial invasion. Not only is it a physical barrier to penetration of deeper tissues by potential pathogens, but it also provides an inhospitable environment for the growth of many pathogens. In this section, we will provide a brief overview of the anatomy and normal microbiota of the skin and eyes, along with general symptoms associated with skin and eye infections.</para>
<section id="fs-id1167660170534">
<title>Layers of the Skin</title>
<para id="fs-id1167662468692">Human skin is made up of several layers and sublayers. The two main layers are the <term id="term-00001">epidermis</term> and the <term id="term-00002">dermis</term>. These layers cover a third layer of tissue called the <term id="term-00003">hypodermis</term>, which consists of fibrous and adipose connective tissue (<link target-id="OSC_Microbio_21_01_skinlayers"/>).</para>
<para id="fs-id1167662738255">The epidermis is the outermost layer of the skin, and it is relatively thin. The exterior surface of the epidermis, called the <term id="term-00004">stratum corneum</term>, primarily consists of dead skin cells. This layer of dead cells limits direct contact between the outside world and live cells. The stratum corneum is rich in <term id="term-00005">keratin</term>, a tough, fibrous protein that is also found in hair and nails. Keratin helps make the outer surface of the skin relatively tough and waterproof. It also helps to keep the surface of the skin dry, which reduces microbial growth. However, some microbes are still able to live on the surface of the skin, and some of these can be shed with dead skin cells in the process of <term id="term-00006">desquamation</term>, which is the shedding and peeling of skin that occurs as a normal process but that may be accelerated when infection is present.</para>
<para id="fs-id1167662467125">Beneath the epidermis lies a thicker skin layer called the <term class="no-emphasis" id="term-00007">dermis</term>. The dermis contains connective tissue and embedded structures such as blood vessels, nerves, and muscles. Structures called <term id="term-00008">hair follicles</term> (from which hair grows) are located within the dermis, even though much of their structure consists of epidermal tissue. The dermis also contains the two major types of glands found in human skin: <term id="term-00009">sweat glands</term> (tubular glands that produce sweat) and <term id="term-00010">sebaceous glands</term> (which are associated with hair follicles and produce <term id="term-00011">sebum</term>, a lipid-rich substance containing proteins and minerals).</para>
<para id="fs-id1167662408322">Perspiration (sweat) provides some moisture to the epidermis, which can increase the potential for microbial growth. For this reason, more microbes are found on the regions of the skin that produce the most sweat, such as the skin of the underarms and groin. However, in addition to water, sweat also contains substances that inhibit microbial growth, such as salts, <term class="no-emphasis" id="term-00012">lysozyme</term>, and <term class="no-emphasis" id="term-00013">antimicrobial peptides</term>. Sebum also serves to protect the skin and reduce water loss. Although some of the lipids and fatty acids in sebum inhibit microbial growth, sebum contains compounds that provide nutrition for certain microbes.</para>

The next layer is lighter and much thicker; this is the dermis. Inside the dermis are vase-shaped hair follicles with hairs projecting out of the skin. Next to the hair follicle is a smaller vase-shape labeled sebaceous gland; this empties into the space of the hair follicle. There are also coiled shapes labeled receptor and a variety of long tubes labeled: nerve, lymph vessel and blood vessels. A coiled blob is labeled sweat gland; this leads to a tube that opens at the surface called a sweat pore. Below the dermis is a yellow bubbly-looking layer labeled fatty tissue; this is the hypodermis.">

<title>Normal Microbiota of the Skin</title>
<para id="fs-id1167660321714">The skin is home to a wide variety of normal microbiota, consisting of commensal organisms that derive nutrition from skin cells and secretions such as sweat and sebum. The normal microbiota of skin tends to inhibit transient-microbe colonization by producing antimicrobial substances and outcompeting other microbes that land on the surface of the skin. This helps to protect the skin from pathogenic infection.</para>
<para id="fs-id1167662520130">The skin’s properties differ from one region of the body to another, as does the composition of the skin’s microbiota. The availability of nutrients and moisture partly dictates which microorganisms will thrive in a particular region of the skin. Relatively moist skin, such as that of the nares (nostrils) and underarms, has a much different microbiota than the dryer skin on the arms, legs, hands, and top of the feet. Some areas of the skin have higher densities of <term class="no-emphasis" id="term-00014">sebaceous glands</term>. These <term class="no-emphasis" id="term-00015">sebum</term>-rich areas, which include the back, the folds at the side of the nose, and the back of the neck, harbor distinct microbial communities that are less diverse than those found on other parts of the body.</para>
<para id="fs-id1167662865856">Different types of bacteria dominate the dry, moist, and sebum-rich regions of the skin. The most abundant microbes typically found in the dry and sebaceous regions are <term class="no-emphasis" id="term-00016">Betaproteobacteria</term> and <term class="no-emphasis" id="term-00017">Propionibacteria</term>, respectively. In the moist regions, <term class="no-emphasis" id="term-00018"><emphasis effect="italics">Corynebacterium</emphasis></term> and <term class="no-emphasis" id="term-00019"><emphasis effect="italics">Staphylococcus</emphasis></term> are most commonly found (<link target-id="OSC_Microbio_21_01_microbiota"/>). Viruses and fungi are also found on the skin, with <term class="no-emphasis" id="term-00020"><emphasis effect="italics">Malassezia</emphasis></term> being the most common type of fungus found as part of the normal microbiota. The role and populations of viruses in the microbiota, known as <term class="no-emphasis" id="term-00021">viromes</term>, are still not well understood, and there are limitations to the techniques used to identify them. However, <term class="no-emphasis" id="term-00022">Circoviridae</term>, <term class="no-emphasis" id="term-00023">Papillomaviridae</term>, and <term class="no-emphasis" id="term-00024">Polyomaviridae</term> appear to be the most common residents in the healthy skin virome.<footnote id="fs-id1167662559464">Belkaid, Y., and J.A.

<title>Infections of the Skin</title>
<para id="fs-id1167660170153">While the microbiota of the skin can play a protective role, it can also cause harm in certain cases. Often, an opportunistic pathogen residing in the skin microbiota of one individual may be transmitted to another individual more susceptible to an infection. For example, methicillin-resistant <emphasis effect="italics">Staphylococcus aureus</emphasis> (<term class="no-emphasis" id="term-00025">MRSA</term>) can often take up residence in the nares of health care workers and hospital patients; though harmless on intact, healthy skin, MRSA can cause infections if introduced into other parts of the body, as might occur during surgery or via a post-surgical incision or wound. This is one reason why clean surgical sites are so important.</para>
<para id="fs-id1167662472646">Injury or damage to the skin can allow microbes to enter deeper tissues, where nutrients are more abundant and the environment is more conducive to bacterial growth. Wound infections are common after a puncture or laceration that damages the physical barrier of the skin. Microbes may infect structures in the <term class="no-emphasis" id="term-00026">dermis</term>, such as <term class="no-emphasis" id="term-00027">hair follicles</term> and <term class="no-emphasis" id="term-00028">glands</term>, causing a localized infection, or they may reach the bloodstream, which can lead to a systemic infection.</para>
<para id="fs-id1167662555843">In some cases, infectious microbes can cause a variety of rashes or lesions that differ in their physical characteristics. These rashes can be the result of inflammation reactions or direct responses to toxins produced by the microbes. <link target-id="fs-id1167662552650"/> lists some of the medical terminology used to describe skin <term class="no-emphasis" id="term-00029">lesions</term> and <term class="no-emphasis" id="term-00030">rashes</term> based on their characteristics; <link target-id="OSC_Microbio_21_01_Lesion"/> and <link target-id="OSC_Microbio_21_01_LesionLine"/> illustrate some of the various types of skin lesions.

<title>Infections of the Eye</title>
<para id="fs-id1167660189838">The conjunctiva is a frequent site of infection of the eye; like other mucous membranes, it is also a common portal of entry for pathogens. Inflammation of the conjunctiva is called <term id="term-00068">conjunctivitis</term>, although it is commonly known as <term class="no-emphasis" id="term-00069">pinkeye</term> because of the pink appearance in the eye. Infections of deeper structures, beneath the cornea, are less common (<link target-id="OSC_Microbio_21_01_ConjBleph"/>). Conjunctivitis occurs in multiple forms. It may be acute or chronic. Acute purulent conjunctivitis is associated with pus formation, while acute hemorrhagic conjunctivitis is associated with bleeding in the conjunctiva. The term <term id="term-00070">blepharitis</term> refers to an inflammation of the eyelids, while <term id="term-00071">keratitis</term> refers to an inflammation of the cornea (<link target-id="OSC_Microbio_21_01_ConjBleph"/>); <term id="term-00072">keratoconjunctivitis</term> is an inflammation of both the cornea and the conjunctiva, and <term id="term-00073">dacryocystitis</term> is an inflammation of the <term class="no-emphasis" id="term-00074">lacrimal sac</term> that can often occur when a <term class="no-emphasis" id="term-00075">nasolacrimal duct</term> is blocked.</para>

<para id="fs-id1167662465574">Infections leading to conjunctivitis, blepharitis, keratoconjunctivitis, or dacryocystitis may be caused by bacteria or viruses, but allergens, pollutants, or chemicals can also irritate the eye and cause inflammation of various structures. Viral infection is a more likely cause of conjunctivitis in cases with symptoms such as fever and watery discharge that occurs with upper respiratory infection and itchy eyes. <link target-id="fs-id1167660218530"/> summarizes some common forms of conjunctivitis and blepharitis.</para>
<table id="fs-id1167660218530" summary="A table titled: Types of conjunctivitis and blepharitis. Each condition has a description and sample causative agents. Acute purulent conjunctivitis is conjunctivitis with purulent discharge and is caused by bacteria (Haemophilus, Staphylococcus). Acute hemorrhagic conjunctivitis involves subconjunctival hemorrhages and is caused by viruses (Picornaviradae). Acute ulcerative blepharitis is an infection involving eyelids; pustules and ulcers may develop and is caused by bacteria (Staphylococcal) or virus (herpes simplex, varicella zoster, etc.). Follicular conjunctivitis is inflammation of the conjunctiva with nodules (dome-shaped structures that are red at the base and pale on top) and is caused by viruses  (adenovirus and others); and environmental irritants. Dacryocystitis is inflammation of the lacrimal sac often associated with a plugged nasolacrimal duct and is caused by bacteria (Haemophilus, Staphylococcus, Streptococcus). Keratitis is inflammation of cornea and is caused by bacteria, viruses, protozoa or environmental irritants. Keratoconjunctivitis is inflammation of cornea and conjunctiva and is caused by bacteria, viruses (adenoviruses), or other causes (including dryness of the eye). Nonulcerative blepharitis is inflammation, irritation, redness of the eyelids without ulceration and is caused by environmental irritants; allergens.Papillary conjunctivitis is inflammation of the conjunctiva; nodules and papillae with red tops develop and is caused by environmental irritants; allergens." class="span-all">
