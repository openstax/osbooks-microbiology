<para id="fs-id1172099571837">The study of microorganisms is greatly facilitated if we are able to culture them, that is, to keep reproducing populations alive under laboratory conditions. Culturing many microorganisms is challenging because of highly specific nutritional and environmental requirements and the diversity of these requirements among different species.</para>
<section id="fs-id1172099547374">
<title>Nutritional Requirements</title>
<para id="fs-id1172101717132">The number of available media to grow bacteria is considerable. Some media are considered general all-purpose media and support growth of a large variety of organisms. A prime example of an all-purpose medium is <term class="no-emphasis" id="term-00001">tryptic soy broth (TSB)</term>. Specialized media are used in the identification of bacteria and are supplemented with dyes, pH indicators, or antibiotics. One type, <term id="term-00002">enriched media</term>, contains growth factors, vitamins, and other essential nutrients to promote the growth of <term id="term-00003">fastidious organisms</term>, organisms that cannot make certain nutrients and require them to be added to the medium. When the complete chemical composition of a medium is known, it is called a <term id="term-00004">chemically defined medium</term>. For example, in <term class="no-emphasis" id="term-00005">EZ medium</term>, all individual chemical components are identified and the exact amounts of each is known. In <term id="term-00006">complex media</term>, which contain extracts and digests of yeasts, meat, or plants, the precise chemical composition of the medium is not known. Amounts of individual components are undetermined and variable. Nutrient broth, tryptic soy broth, and <term class="no-emphasis" id="term-00007">brain heart infusion</term>, are all examples of complex media.</para>
<para id="para-00001">
  Non-selective media support the growth of all microorganisms without any specific inhibition. They may be used to cultivate organisms for other uses, as well as in specific procedures. The Mueller-Hinton agar, developed by John Mueller and Jane Hinton, is a non-selective media often used to test antibiotics and such as in the Kirby-Bauer disc diffusion test (described in the chapter on <link document="m58857">Antimicrobial Drugs</link>). In addition to beef extract and agar, it contains starch, which supports growth and also absorbs toxins, which ensures that the antibiotics continue to function. Mueller-Hinton agar is also known as a loose agar, which allows chemicals to diffuse more effectively than similar substances.
</para>
<para id="fs-id1172099767850">Media that inhibit the growth of unwanted microorganisms and support the growth of the organism of interest by supplying nutrients and reducing competition are called <term id="term-00008">selective media</term>. An example of a selective medium is <term class="no-emphasis" id="term-00009">MacConkey agar</term>. It contains bile salts and crystal violet, which interfere with the growth of many <term class="no-emphasis" id="term-00010">gram-positive bacteria</term> and favor the growth of <term class="no-emphasis" id="term-00011">gram-negative bacteria</term>, particularly the <term class="no-emphasis" id="term-00012">Enterobacteriaceae</term>. These species are commonly named enterics, reside in the intestine, and are adapted to the presence of bile salts. The <term id="term-00013">enrichment culture</term>s foster the preferential growth of a desired microorganism that represents a fraction of the organisms present in an inoculum. For example, if we want to isolate bacteria that break down crude oil, <term class="no-emphasis" id="term-00014">hydrocarbonoclastic bacteria</term>, sequential subculturing in a medium that supplies carbon only in the form of crude oil will enrich the cultures with oil-eating bacteria. The <term id="term-00015">differential media</term> make it easy to distinguish colonies of different bacteria by a change in the color of the colonies or the color of the medium. Color changes are the result of end products created by interaction of bacterial enzymes with differential substrates in the medium or, in the case of hemolytic reactions, the lysis of red blood cells in the medium. In <link target-id="OSC_Microbio_09_05_MacMsa"/>, the differential fermentation of lactose can be observed on MacConkey agar. The lactose fermenters produce acid, which turns the medium and the colonies of strong fermenters hot pink. The medium is supplemented with the pH indicator neutral red, which turns to hot pink at low pH. Selective and differential media can be combined and play an important role in the identification of bacteria by biochemical methods.</para>

<title>The End-of-Year Picnic</title>
<para id="fs-id1172099546081">The microbiology department is celebrating the end of the school year in May by holding its traditional picnic on the green. The speeches drag on for a couple of hours, but finally all the faculty and students can dig into the food: chicken salad, tomatoes, onions, salad, and custard pie. By evening, the whole department, except for two vegetarian students who did not eat the chicken salad, is stricken with nausea, vomiting, retching, and abdominal cramping. Several individuals complain of diarrhea. One patient shows signs of shock (low blood pressure). Blood and stool samples are collected from patients, and an analysis of all foods served at the meal is conducted.</para>
<para id="fs-id1172099675047">Bacteria can cause <term class="no-emphasis" id="term-00016">gastroenteritis</term> (inflammation of the stomach and intestinal tract) either by colonizing and replicating in the host, which is considered an infection, or by secreting toxins, which is considered intoxication. Signs and symptoms of infections are typically delayed, whereas intoxication manifests within hours, as happened after the picnic.</para>
<para id="fs-id1172101995583">Blood samples from the patients showed no signs of bacterial infection, which further suggests that this was a case of intoxication. Since intoxication is due to secreted toxins, bacteria are not usually detected in blood or stool samples. MacConkey agar and <term class="no-emphasis" id="term-00017">sorbitol-MacConkey agar</term> plates and <term class="no-emphasis" id="term-00018">xylose-lysine-deoxycholate</term> (XLD) plates were inoculated with stool samples and did not reveal any unusually colored colonies, and no black colonies or white colonies were observed on XLD. All lactose fermenters on MacConkey agar also ferment sorbitol. These results ruled out common agents of food-borne illnesses: <emphasis effect="italics">E. coli</emphasis>, <term class="no-emphasis" id="term-00019"><emphasis effect="italics">Salmonella</emphasis></term> spp., and <term class="no-emphasis" id="term-00020"><emphasis effect="italics">Shigella</emphasis></term> spp.</para>
<para id="fs-id1172099376213">Analysis of the chicken salad revealed an abnormal number of gram-positive cocci arranged in clusters (<link target-id="OSC_Microbio_09_05_saureus"/>). A culture of the gram-positive cocci releases bubbles when mixed with hydrogen peroxide. The culture turned <term class="no-emphasis" id="term-00021">mannitol salt agar</term> yellow after a 24-hour incubation.</para>
<para id="fs-id1172099681932">All the tests point to <term class="no-emphasis" id="term-00022"><emphasis effect="italics">Staphylococcus aureus</emphasis></term> as the organism that secreted the toxin. Samples from the salad showed the presence of gram-positive cocci bacteria in clusters. The colonies were positive for catalase. The bacteria grew on mannitol salt agar fermenting mannitol, as shown by the change to yellow of the medium. The pH indicator in mannitol salt agar is phenol red, which turns to yellow when the medium is acidified by the products of fermentation.</para>
<para id="fs-id1172099538510">The toxin secreted by <emphasis effect="italics">S. aureus</emphasis> is known to cause severe gastroenteritis. The organism was probably introduced into the salad during preparation by the food handler and multiplied while the salad was kept in the warm ambient temperature during the speeches.</para>
