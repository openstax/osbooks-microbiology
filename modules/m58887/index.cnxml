<title>B Cell Production and Maturation</title>
<para id="fs-id1167663955901">Like T cells, B cells are formed from multipotent <term class="no-emphasis" id="term-00001">hematopoietic stem cells</term> (HSCs) in the bone marrow and follow a pathway through lymphoid stem cell and lymphoblast (see <link document="m58879" target-id="OSC_Microbio_17_05_Hematopo"/>). Unlike T cells, however, lymphoblasts destined to become B cells do not leave the <term class="no-emphasis" id="term-00002">bone marrow</term> and travel to the thymus for maturation. Rather, eventual B cells continue to mature in the bone marrow.</para>
<para id="fs-id1167663901968">The first step of B cell maturation is an assessment of the functionality of their antigen-binding receptors. This occurs through <term class="no-emphasis" id="term-00003">positive selection</term> for B cells with normal functional receptors. A mechanism of <term class="no-emphasis" id="term-00004">negative selection</term> is then used to eliminate <term class="no-emphasis" id="term-00005">self-reacting B cells</term> and minimize the risk of <term class="no-emphasis" id="term-00006">autoimmunity</term>. Negative selection of self-reacting B cells can involve elimination by <term class="no-emphasis" id="term-00007">apoptosis</term>, editing or modification of the receptors so they are no longer self-reactive, or induction of <term class="no-emphasis" id="term-00008">anergy</term> in the B cell. Immature B cells that pass the selection in the bone marrow then travel to the <term class="no-emphasis" id="term-00009">spleen</term> for their final stages of maturation. There they become <term id="term-00010">naïve mature B cells</term>, i.e., mature B cells that have not yet been activated.</para>

<title>B-Cell Receptors</title>
<para id="fs-id1167661462672">Like T cells, B cells possess antigen-specific receptors with diverse specificities. Although they rely on T cells for optimum function, B cells can be activated without help from T cells. <term id="term-00011">B-cell receptors (BCRs)</term> for naïve mature B cells are membrane-bound monomeric forms of <term class="no-emphasis" id="term-00012">IgD</term> and <term class="no-emphasis" id="term-00013">IgM</term>. They have two identical <term class="no-emphasis" id="term-00014">heavy chains</term> and two identical <term class="no-emphasis" id="term-00015">light chains</term> connected by disulfide bonds into a basic “Y” shape (<link target-id="OSC_Microbio_18_04_BCR"/>). The trunk of the Y-shaped molecule, the constant region of the two heavy chains, spans the B cell membrane. The two <term class="no-emphasis" id="term-00016">antigen-binding sites</term> exposed to the exterior of the B cell are involved in the binding of specific pathogen epitopes to initiate the activation process. It is estimated that each naïve mature B cell has upwards of 100,000 BCRs on its membrane, and each of these BCRs has an identical epitope-binding specificity.</para>
<para id="fs-id1167664003850">In order to be prepared to react to a wide range of microbial epitopes, B cells, like T cells, use <term class="no-emphasis" id="term-00017">genetic rearrangement</term> of hundreds of gene segments to provide the necessary diversity of receptor specificities. The variable region of the <term class="no-emphasis" id="term-00018">BCR</term> heavy chain is made up of <term class="no-emphasis" id="term-00019">V, D, and J segments</term>, similar to the β chain of the TCR. The variable region of the BCR light chain is made up of V and J segments, similar to the α chain of the TCR. Genetic rearrangement of all possible combinations of V-J-D (heavy chain) and V-J (light chain) provides for millions of unique antigen-binding sites for the BCR and for the antibodies secreted after activation.</para>
<para id="fs-id1167661618645">One important difference between BCRs and TCRs is the way they can interact with antigenic epitopes. Whereas TCRs can only interact with antigenic epitopes that are presented within the antigen-binding cleft of <term class="no-emphasis" id="term-00020">MHC I</term> or <term class="no-emphasis" id="term-00021">MHC II</term>, BCRs do not require antigen presentation with MHC; they can interact with epitopes on free antigens or with <term class="no-emphasis" id="term-00022">epitopes</term> displayed on the surface of intact pathogens. Another important difference is that TCRs only recognize protein epitopes, whereas BCRs can recognize epitopes associated with different molecular classes (e.g., proteins, polysaccharides, lipopolysaccharides).</para>
<para id="fs-id1167661364633">Activation of B cells occurs through different mechanisms depending on the molecular class of the antigen. Activation of a B cell by a protein antigen requires the B cell to function as an APC, presenting the protein epitopes with MHC II to helper T cells. Because of their dependence on T cells for <term class="no-emphasis" id="term-00023">activation of B cells</term>, protein antigens are classified as <term id="term-00024">T-dependent antigens</term>. In contrast, polysaccharides, lipopolysaccharides, and other nonprotein antigens are considered <term id="term-00025">T-independent antigens</term> because they can activate B cells without antigen processing and presentation to T cells.</para>

<title>T Cell-Independent Activation of B cells</title>
<para id="fs-id1167659203063">Activation of B cells without the cooperation of helper T cells is referred to as <term class="no-emphasis" id="term-00026">T cell-independent activation</term> and occurs when BCRs interact with T-independent antigens.

<title>T Cell-Dependent Activation of B cells</title>
<para id="fs-id1167663585424">T cell-dependent activation of B cells is more complex than T cell-independent activation, but the resulting immune response is stronger and develops memory. T cell-dependent activation can occur either in response to <term class="no-emphasis" id="term-00036">free protein antigens</term> or to protein antigens associated with an intact pathogen. Interaction between the BCRs on a naïve mature B cell and a free protein antigen stimulate <term class="no-emphasis" id="term-00037">internalization</term> of the antigen, whereas interaction with antigens associated with an intact pathogen initiates the extraction of the antigen from the pathogen before internalization. Once internalized inside the B cell, the protein antigen is processed and presented with <term class="no-emphasis" id="term-00038">MHC II</term>.

<title>Primary and Secondary Responses</title>
<para id="fs-id1167661291167">T cell-dependent activation of B cells plays an important role in both the primary and secondary responses associated with adaptive immunity. With the first exposure to a protein antigen, a T cell-dependent <term class="no-emphasis" id="term-00055">primary antibody response</term> occurs. The initial stage of the primary response is a <term id="term-00056">lag period</term>, or <term class="no-emphasis" id="term-00057">latent period</term>, of approximately 10 days, during which no antibody can be detected in serum. This lag period is the time required for all of the steps of the primary response, including naïve mature B cell binding of antigen with BCRs, antigen processing and presentation, helper T cell activation, B cell activation, and clonal proliferation. The end of the lag period is characterized by a rise in IgM levels in the serum, as <term class="no-emphasis" id="term-00058">T<sub>H</sub>2 cells</term> stimulate B cell differentiation into <term class="no-emphasis" id="term-00059">plasma cells</term>. <term class="no-emphasis" id="term-00060">IgM</term> levels reach their peak around 14 days after primary antigen exposure; at about this same time, T<sub>H</sub>2 stimulates antibody class switching, and IgM levels in serum begin to decline. Meanwhile, levels of IgG increase until they reach a peak about three weeks into the primary response (<link target-id="OSC_Microbio_18_04_PriSec"/>).</para>
<para id="fs-id1167661508248">During the primary response, some of the cloned B cells are differentiated into <term class="no-emphasis" id="term-00061">memory B cells</term> programmed to respond to subsequent exposures. This <term class="no-emphasis" id="term-00062">secondary response</term> occurs more quickly and forcefully than the primary response. The lag period is decreased to only a few days and the production of IgG is significantly higher than observed for the primary response (<link target-id="OSC_Microbio_18_04_PriSec"/>). In addition, the antibodies produced during the secondary response are more effective and bind with higher affinity to the targeted epitopes. Plasma cells produced during secondary responses live longer than those produced during the primary response, so levels of specific antibody remain elevated for a longer period of time.</para>

The lag period does not see a significant increase. In the primary response, IgM peaks for about 5 days and drops. At the same time IgG increases and then drops. This creates an increase in antibody count with a plateau of about 5 days as both antibody types are present. The secondary response sees a prolonged peak of IgG with a peak of IgM for about 1 to 2 days at about the same time as the peak of IgG.
