<para id="fs-id1167663533877">Fungal pathogens are ubiquitous in the environment. Serological studies have demonstrated that most people have been exposed to fungal respiratory pathogens during their lives. Yet symptomatic infections by these microbes are rare in healthy individuals. This demonstrates the efficacy of the defenses of our respiratory system. In this section, we will examine some of the fungi that can cause respiratory infections.</para>

<title>Histoplasmosis</title>
<para id="fs-id1167661429203">Histoplasmosis is a fungal disease of the respiratory system and most commonly occurs in the Mississippi Valley of the United States and in parts of Central and South America, Africa, Asia, and Australia. The causative agent, <term class="no-emphasis" id="term-00001"><emphasis effect="italics">Histoplasma capsulatum</emphasis></term>, is a dimorphic fungus. This microbe grows as a filamentous mold in the environment but occurs as a budding yeast during human infections. The primary reservoir for this pathogen is soil, particularly in locations rich in bat or bird feces.</para>
<para id="fs-id1167661748883">Histoplasmosis is acquired by inhaling microconidial spores in the air; this disease is not transmitted from human to human. The incidence of <term id="term-00002">histoplasmosis</term> exposure is high in endemic areas, with 60%–90% of the population having anti-<emphasis effect="italics">Histoplasma</emphasis> antibodies, depending on location;<footnote id="fs-id1167661517776">NE Manos et al. “Geographic Variation in the Prevalence of Histoplasmin Sensitivity.” <emphasis effect="italics">Dis Chest</emphasis> 29, no. 6 (1956):649–668.</footnote> however, relatively few individuals exposed to the fungus actually experience symptoms. Those most likely to be affected are the very young, the elderly, and immunocompromised people.</para>
<para id="fs-id1167661463128">In many ways, the course of this disease is similar to that of tuberculosis. Following inhalation, the spores enter the lungs and are phagocytized by alveolar macrophages. The fungal cells then survive and multiply within these phagocytes (see <link document="m58804" target-id="OSC_Microbio_05_03_struct"/>). Focal infections cause the formation of granulomatous lesions, which can lead to calcifications that resemble the Ghon complexes of tuberculosis, even in asymptomatic cases. Also like tuberculosis, histoplasmosis can become chronic and reactivation can occur, along with dissemination to other areas of the body (e.g., the liver or spleen).</para>
<para id="fs-id1167661335335">Signs and symptoms of pulmonary histoplasmosis include fever, headache, and weakness with some chest discomfort. The initial diagnosis is often based on chest radiographs and cultures grown on fungal selective media like <term class="no-emphasis" id="term-00003">Sabouraud's dextrose agar</term>. Direct fluorescence antibody staining and <term class="no-emphasis" id="term-00004">Giemsa staining</term> can also be used to detect this pathogen. In addition, serological tests including a complement fixation assay and histoplasmin sensitivity can be used to confirm the diagnosis. In most cases, these infections are self-limiting and antifungal therapy is not required. However, in disseminated disease, the antifungal agents <term class="no-emphasis" id="term-00005">amphotericin B</term> and <term class="no-emphasis" id="term-00006">ketoconazole</term> are effective; <term class="no-emphasis" id="term-00007">itraconazole</term> may be effective in immunocompromised patients, in whom the disease can be more serious.</para>

Because the microbe is endemic to the San Joaquin Valley of California, the disease is sometimes referred to as Valley fever. A related species that causes similar infections is found in semi-arid and arid regions of the southwestern United States, Mexico, and Central and South America.<footnote id="fs-id1167663661835">DR Hospenthal. “Coccioidomycosis.” Medscape. 2015. http://emedicine.medscape.com/article/215978-overview.

<para id="fs-id1167663588500">Like histoplasmosis, coccidioidomycosis is acquired by inhaling fungal spores—in this case, arthrospores formed by hyphal fragmentation. Once in the body, the fungus differentiates into spherules that are filled with endospores. Most <emphasis effect="italics">C. immitis</emphasis> infections are asymptomatic and self-limiting. However, the infection can be very serious for immunocompromised patients. The endospores may be transported in the blood, disseminating the infection and leading to the formation of <term class="no-emphasis" id="term-00010">granulomatous lesions</term> on the face and nose (<link target-id="OSC_Microbio_22_04_Coccidioid"/>). In severe cases, other major organs can become infected, leading to serious complications such as fatal <term class="no-emphasis" id="term-00011">meningitis</term>.</para>
<para id="fs-id1167661617259">Coccidioidomycosis can be diagnosed by culturing clinical samples. <emphasis effect="italics">C. immitis</emphasis> readily grows on laboratory fungal media, such as <term class="no-emphasis" id="term-00012">Sabouraud's dextrose agar</term>, at 35 °C (95 °F). Culturing the fungus, however, is rather dangerous. <emphasis effect="italics">C. immitis</emphasis> is one of the most infectious fungal pathogens known and is capable of causing laboratory-acquired infections. Indeed, until 2012, this organism was considered a “select agent” of bioterrorism and classified as a <term class="no-emphasis" id="term-00013">BSL-3 microbe</term>. Serological tests for antibody production are more often used for diagnosis.

<para id="fs-id1167664004360">Although most people are regularly exposed to the causative agents of mucormycosis, infections in healthy individuals are rare. Exposure to spores from the environment typically occurs through inhalation, but the spores can also infect the skin through a wound or the gastrointestinal tract if ingested. Respiratory mucormycosis primarily affects immunocompromised individuals, such as patients with cancer or those who have had a transplant.<footnote id="fs-id1167663932184">Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. “Fungal Diseases.

<para id="fs-id1167663659365">After the spores are inhaled, the fungi grow by extending hyphae into the host’s tissues. Infections can occur in both the upper and lower respiratory tracts. Rhinocerebral mucormycosis is an infection of the sinuses and brain; symptoms include headache, fever, facial swelling, congestion, and tissue necrosis causing black lesions in the oral cavity. Pulmonary mucormycosis is an infection of the lungs; symptoms include fever, cough, chest pain, and shortness of breath. In severe cases, infections may become disseminated and involve the central nervous system, leading to coma and death.<footnote id="fs-id1167663902121">Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. “Fungal Diseases.

<item><emphasis effect="bold">Coccidioidomycosis</emphasis> is also acquired from soil and, in some individuals, will cause lesions on the face. Extreme cases may infect other organs, causing death.</item>
<item><emphasis effect="bold">Blastomycosis</emphasis>, a rare disease caused by a soil fungus, typically produces a mild lung infection but can become disseminated in the immunocompromised. Systemic cases are fatal if untreated.</item>
<item><emphasis effect="bold">Mucormycosis</emphasis> is a rare disease, caused by fungi of the order Mucorales. It primarily affects immunocompromised people. Infection involves growth of the hyphae into infected tissues and can lead to death in some cases.</item>
<item><emphasis effect="bold">Aspergillosis</emphasis>, caused by the common soil fungus <emphasis effect="italics">Aspergillus</emphasis>, infects immunocompromised people. Hyphal balls may impede lung function and hyphal growth into tissues can cause damage. Disseminated forms can lead to death.</item>
<item><emphasis effect="bold"><emphasis effect="italics">Pneumocystis</emphasis> pneumonia</emphasis> is caused by the fungus <emphasis effect="italics">P. jirovecii</emphasis>. The disease is found in patients with AIDS and other immunocompromised individuals. Sulfa drug treatments have side effects, but untreated cases may be fatal.</item>
<item><emphasis effect="bold">Cryptococcosis</emphasis> is caused by <emphasis effect="italics">Cryptococcus neoformans</emphasis>. Lung infections may move to the brain, causing meningitis, which can be fatal.</item>
