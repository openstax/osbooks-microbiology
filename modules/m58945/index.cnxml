<para id="fs-id1167661354272">Barbara is a 43-year-old patient who has been diagnosed with metastatic inflammatory breast cancer. To facilitate her ongoing chemotherapy, her physician implanted a port attached to a central venous catheter. At a recent checkup, she reported feeling restless and complained that the site of the catheter had become uncomfortable. After removing the dressing, the physician observed that the surgical site appeared red and was warm to the touch, suggesting a localized infection. Barbara’s was also running a fever of 38.2 °C (100.8 °F). Her physician treated the affected area with a topical antiseptic and applied a fresh dressing. She also prescribed a course of the antibiotic oxacillin.</para>

<para id="fs-id1167663965448">The circulatory and lymphatic systems are networks of vessels and a pump that transport blood and lymph, respectively, throughout the body. When these systems are infected with a microorganism, the network of vessels can facilitate the rapid dissemination of the microorganism to other regions of the body, sometimes with serious results. In this section, we will examine some of the key anatomical features of the circulatory and lymphatic systems, as well as general signs and symptoms of infection.</para>

<title>The Circulatory System</title>
<para id="fs-id1167661318080">The circulatory (or cardiovascular) system is a closed network of organs and vessels that moves blood around the body (<link target-id="OSC_Microbio_25_01_CircSyst"/>). The primary purposes of the <term class="no-emphasis" id="term-00001">circulatory system</term> are to deliver nutrients, immune factors, and oxygen to tissues and to carry away waste products for elimination. The <term class="no-emphasis" id="term-00002">heart</term> is a four-chambered pump that propels the blood throughout the body. Deoxygenated blood enters the right atrium through the superior vena cava and the inferior vena cava after returning from the body. The blood next passes through the tricuspid valve to enter the right ventricle. When the heart contracts, the blood from the right ventricle is pumped through the pulmonary arteries to the lungs. There, the blood is oxygenated at the alveoli and returns to the heart through the pulmonary veins. The oxygenated blood is received at the left atrium and proceeds through the mitral valve to the left ventricle. When the heart contracts, the oxygenated blood is pumped throughout the body via a series of thick-walled vessels called arteries. The first and largest <term id="term-00003">artery</term> is called the aorta. The arteries sequentially branch and decrease in size (and are called arterioles) until they end in a network of smaller vessels called capillaries. The <term id="term-00004">capillary</term> beds are located in the interstitial spaces within tissues and release nutrients, immune factors, and oxygen to those tissues. The capillaries connect to a series of vessels called venules, which increase in size to form the <term id="term-00005">vein</term>s. The veins join together into larger vessels as they transfer blood back to the heart. The largest veins, the superior and inferior vena cava, return the blood to the right atrium.</para>

<title>The Lymphatic System</title>
<para id="fs-id1167663732757">The <term class="no-emphasis" id="term-00009">lymphatic system</term> is also a network of vessels that run throughout the body (<link target-id="OSC_Microbio_25_01_LymphSyst"/>). However, these vessels do not form a full circulating system and are not pressurized by the heart. Rather, the lymphatic system is an open system with the fluid moving in one direction from the extremities toward two drainage points into veins just above the heart. Lymphatic fluids move more slowly than blood because they are not pressurized. Small lymph capillaries interact with blood capillaries in the interstitial spaces in tissues. Fluids from the tissues enter the lymph capillaries and are drained away (<link target-id="OSC_Microbio_25_01_CapBed"/>). These fluids, termed <term class="no-emphasis" id="term-00010">lymph</term>, also contain large numbers of white blood cells.</para>

<para id="fs-id1167661539752">The lymphatic system contains two types of lymphoid tissues. The <term id="term-00011">primary lymphoid tissue</term> includes bone marrow and the thymus. Bone marrow contains the hematopoietic stem cells (HSC) that differentiate and mature into the various types of blood cells and lymphocytes (see <link document="m58879" target-id="OSC_Microbio_17_05_Hematopo"/>). The <term id="term-00012">secondary lymphoid tissue</term><emphasis effect="bold">s</emphasis> include the spleen, lymph nodes, and several areas of diffuse lymphoid tissues underlying epithelial membranes. The <term id="term-00013">spleen</term>, an encapsulated structure, filters blood and captures pathogens and antigens that pass into it (<link target-id="OSC_Microbio_25_01_spleenLnode"/>). The spleen contains specialized macrophages and dendritic cells that are crucial for antigen presentation, a mechanism critical for activation of T lymphocytes and B lymphocytes (see <link document="m58885">Major Histocompatibility Complexes and Antigen-Presenting Cells</link>). Lymph nodes are bean-shaped organs situated throughout the body. These structures contain areas called germinal centers that are rich in B and T lymphocytes. The <term id="term-00014">lymph nodes</term> also contain macrophages and dendritic cells for antigen presentation.

<title>Infections of the Circulatory System</title>
<para id="fs-id1167661250898">Under normal circumstances, the circulatory system and the blood should be sterile; the circulatory system has no normal microbiota. Because the system is closed, there are no easy portals of entry into the circulatory system for microbes. Those that are able to breach the body’s physical barriers and enter the bloodstream encounter a host of circulating immune defenses, such as antibodies, complement proteins, phagocytes, and other immune cells. Microbes often gain access to the circulatory system through a break in the skin (e.g., wounds, needles, intravenous catheters, insect bites) or spread to the circulatory system from infections in other body sites. For example, microorganisms causing pneumonia or renal infection may enter the local circulation of the lung or kidney and spread from there throughout the circulatory network.</para>
<para id="fs-id1167663608897">If microbes in the bloodstream are not quickly eliminated, they can spread rapidly throughout the body, leading to serious, even life-threatening infections. Various terms are used to describe conditions involving microbes in the circulatory system. The term <term id="term-00016">bacteremia</term> refers to bacteria in the blood. If bacteria are reproducing in the blood as they spread, this condition is called <term id="term-00017">septicemia</term>. The presence of viruses in the blood is called <term id="term-00018">viremia</term>. Microbial toxins can also be spread through the circulatory system, causing a condition termed <term id="term-00019">toxemia</term>.</para>
<para id="fs-id1167661582041">Microbes and microbial toxins in the blood can trigger an inflammatory response so severe that the inflammation damages host tissues and organs more than the infection itself. This counterproductive immune response is called <term id="term-00020">systemic inflammatory response syndrome (SIRS)</term>, and it can lead to the life-threatening condition known as <term id="term-00021">sepsis</term>. Sepsis is characterized by the production of excess <term class="no-emphasis" id="term-00022">cytokines</term> that leads to classic signs of <term class="no-emphasis" id="term-00023">inflammation</term> such as fever, <term class="no-emphasis" id="term-00024">vasodilation</term>, and <term class="no-emphasis" id="term-00025">edema</term> (see <link document="m58881">Inflammation and Fever</link>). In a patient with sepsis, the inflammatory response becomes dysregulated and disproportionate to the threat of infection. Critical organs such as the heart, lungs, liver, and kidneys become dysfunctional, resulting in increased heart and respiratory rates, and disorientation. If not treated promptly and effectively, patients with sepsis can go into shock and die.</para>
<para id="fs-id1167661370893">Certain infections can cause inflammation in the heart and blood vessels. Inflammation of the endocardium, the inner lining of the heart, is called <term id="term-00026">endocarditis</term> and can result in damage to the heart valves severe enough to require surgical replacement. Inflammation of the pericardium, the sac surrounding the heart, is called <term id="term-00027">pericarditis</term>. The term <term id="term-00028">myocarditis</term> refers to the inflammation of the heart’s muscle tissue. Pericarditis and myocarditis can cause fluid to accumulate around the heart, resulting in congestive heart failure. Inflammation of blood vessels is called <term id="term-00029">vasculitis</term>. Although somewhat rare, vasculitis can cause blood vessels to become damaged and rupture; as blood is released, small red or purple spots called <term id="term-00030">petechiae</term> appear on the skin. If the damage of tissues or blood vessels is severe, it can result in reduced blood flow to the surrounding tissues. This condition is called <term id="term-00031">ischemia</term>, and it can be very serious. In severe cases, the affected tissues can die and become necrotic; these situations may require surgical debridement or amputation.</para>

<title>Infections of the Lymphatic System</title>
<para id="fs-id1167661730550">Like the circulatory system, the lymphatic system does not have a normal microbiota, and the large numbers of immune cells typically eliminate transient microbes before they can establish an infection. Only microbes with an array of virulence factors are able to overcome these defenses and establish infection in the lymphatic system. However, when a localized infection begins to spread, the lymphatic system is often the first place the invading microbes can be detected.</para>
<para id="fs-id1167663967797">Infections in the lymphatic system also trigger an inflammatory response. Inflammation of lymphatic vessels, called <term id="term-00032">lymphangitis</term>, can produce visible red streaks under the skin. Inflammation in the lymph nodes can cause them to swell. A swollen lymph node is referred to as a <term id="term-00033">bubo</term>, and the condition is referred to as <term id="term-00034">lymphadenitis</term>.</para>
