<para id="fs-id1167663742771">Heterotrophic organisms ranging from <emphasis effect="italics">E. coli</emphasis> to humans rely on the chemical energy found mainly in carbohydrate molecules.

Although photosynthesis is most commonly associated with plants, microbial photosynthesis is also a significant supplier of chemical energy, fueling many diverse ecosystems. In this section, we will focus on microbial photosynthesis.</para>
<para id="fs-id1167663900049">Photosynthesis takes place in two sequential stages: the light-dependent reactions and the light-independent reactions (<link target-id="OSC_Microbio_08_06_LightDepIn"/>). In the <term id="term-00002">light-dependent reaction</term><emphasis effect="bold">s</emphasis>, energy from sunlight is absorbed by pigment molecules in photosynthetic membranes and converted into stored chemical energy. In the <term id="term-00003">light-independent reaction</term><emphasis effect="bold">s</emphasis>, the chemical energy produced by the light-dependent reactions is used to drive the assembly of sugar molecules using CO<sub>2</sub>; however, these reactions are still light dependent because the products of the light-dependent reactions necessary for driving them are short-lived. The light-dependent reactions produce ATP and either NADPH or NADH to temporarily store energy. These energy carriers are used in the light-independent reactions to drive the energetically unfavorable process of “fixing” inorganic CO<sub>2</sub> in an organic form, sugar.</para>

<title>Photosynthetic Structures in Eukaryotes and Prokaryotes</title>
<para id="fs-id1167661292885">In all <term class="no-emphasis" id="term-00004">phototrophic eukaryotes</term>, photosynthesis takes place inside a <term id="term-00005">chloroplast</term>, an organelle that arose in eukaryotes by endosymbiosis of a photosynthetic bacterium (see <link document="m58793">Unique Characteristics of Eukaryotic Cells</link>). These chloroplasts are enclosed by a double membrane with inner and outer layers. Within the chloroplast is a third membrane that forms stacked, disc-shaped photosynthetic structures called <term class="no-emphasis" id="term-00006">thylakoid</term>s (<link target-id="OSC_Microbio_08_06_PhotoMemb"/>). A stack of thylakoids is called a <term class="no-emphasis" id="term-00007">granum</term>, and the space surrounding the granum within the chloroplast is called <term class="no-emphasis" id="term-00008">stroma</term>.</para>
<para id="fs-id1167661428556">Photosynthetic membranes in prokaryotes, by contrast, are not organized into distinct membrane-enclosed organelles; rather, they are infolded regions of the plasma membrane. In cyanobacteria, for example, these infolded regions are also referred to as thylakoids. In either case, embedded within the thylakoid membranes or other photosynthetic bacterial membranes are <term id="term-00009">photosynthetic pigment</term> molecules organized into one or more photosystems, where light energy is actually converted into chemical energy.</para>
<para id="fs-id1167661325742">Photosynthetic pigments within the photosynthetic membranes are organized into <term id="term-00010">photosystem</term><emphasis effect="bold">s</emphasis>, each of which is composed of a light-harvesting (antennae) complex and a reaction center. The <term id="term-00011">light-harvesting complex</term> consists of multiple proteins and associated pigments that each may absorb light energy and, thus, become excited. This energy is transferred from one pigment molecule to another until eventually (after about a millionth of a second) it is delivered to the reaction center. Up to this point, only energy—not electrons—has been transferred between molecules. The <term id="term-00012">reaction center</term> contains a pigment molecule that can undergo oxidation upon excitation, actually giving up an electron. It is at this step in <term class="no-emphasis" id="term-00013">photosynthesis</term> that light energy is converted into an excited electron.</para>
<para id="fs-id1167661618085">Different kinds of light-harvesting pigments absorb unique patterns of wavelengths (colors) of visible light. Pigments reflect or transmit the wavelengths they cannot absorb, making them appear the corresponding color. Examples of photosynthetic pigments (molecules used to absorb solar energy) are <term class="no-emphasis" id="term-00014">bacteriochlorophyll</term>s (green, purple, or red), <term class="no-emphasis" id="term-00015">carotenoid</term>s (orange, red, or yellow), <term class="no-emphasis" id="term-00016">chlorophyll</term>s (green), <term class="no-emphasis" id="term-00017">phycocyanins</term> (blue), and <term class="no-emphasis" id="term-00018">phycoerythrins</term> (red). By having mixtures of pigments, an organism can absorb energy from more wavelengths. Because photosynthetic bacteria commonly grow in competition for sunlight, each type of photosynthetic bacteria is optimized for harvesting the wavelengths of light to which it is commonly exposed, leading to stratification of microbial communities in aquatic and soil ecosystems by light quality and penetration.</para>
<para id="fs-id1167661736290">Once the light harvesting complex transfers the energy to the reaction center, the reaction center delivers its high-energy electrons, one by one, to an electron carrier in an <term class="no-emphasis" id="term-00019">electron transport system</term>, and electron transfer through the <term class="no-emphasis" id="term-00020">ETS</term> is initiated.

<para id="fs-id1167661567803">After several scientists hypothesized that two light reactions, rather than one, were required to split water and capture energy, Joan Mary Anderson undertook a series of experiments to prove the existence of two types of photosystems: <term class="no-emphasis" id="term-00030">photosystem I (PSI)</term> and <term class="no-emphasis" id="term-00031">photosystem II (PSII)</term> (<link target-id="OSC_Microbio_08_06_PSI_PSII"/>). Working with colleague Keith Boardman, Anderson chemically fragmented active chloroplasts, then used a centrifuge to separate the components. She was able to demonstrate that different portions of the chloroplasts produced different products, thereby showing that there were two parts to the photosystems. This work also laid the foundation to understanding how the structures within the chloroplasts related to the different systems. Cyanobacteria and plant chloroplasts have both photosystems, whereas anoxygenic photosynthetic bacteria use only one of the photosystems. Both photosystems are excited by light energy simultaneously. If the cell requires both ATP and NADPH for biosynthesis, then it will carry out <term id="term-00032">noncyclic photophosphorylation</term>. Upon passing of the PSII reaction center electron to the ETS that connects PSII and PSI, the lost electron from the PSII reaction center is replaced by the splitting of water. The excited PSI reaction center electron is used to reduce NADP<sup>+</sup> to NADPH and is replaced by the electron exiting the ETS. The flow of electrons in this way is called the <term id="term-00033">Z-scheme</term>.</para>
<para id="fs-id1167661440208">If a cell’s need for ATP is significantly greater than its need for NADPH, it may bypass the production of reducing power through <term id="term-00034">cyclic photophosphorylation</term>. Only PSI is used during cyclic photophosphorylation; the high-energy electron of the PSI reaction center is passed to an ETS carrier and then ultimately returns to the oxidized PSI reaction center pigment, thereby reducing it.</para>

<media id="fs-id1167663970157" alt="a) Drawing of a thylakoid membrane with proteins. Light strikes PS II which breaks water into ½ O2, 2 H+ and an electron. The electron moves to PO, PQH2, cytochrome, PO, and then to PSI. This is an electron transport chain and as the electron moves, H+ is pumped from the stroma to the thylakoid space. Light Strikes PSI and the electron is excited again; it is then moved to FD and then NADP+ reductase. This produces NADPH from NADP+ and H+. Protons from the inner thylakoid space move out to the stroma through ATP synthase which produces ATP. B) the same diagram but in a graphical format with amount of energy on the Y axis. PSII has an antenna pigment and P680 which absorbs light at 680 nm. This excites the electron (moves it up in the graph). The electron then decreases in energy as it moves from PO to OQHS, to cytochrome, to PO and then to PS I. Light at 700 nm strikes P700 and the electron is excited again. The electron then decreases in energy as it moves from FD to NADP+ reductase to NADPH. Moving from PSII to NADPH is non-cyclic photosynthesis. Cyclic photosynthesis is when the electron moves from PSI back to PS II.">

<caption>(a) PSI and PSII are found on the thylakoid membrane. The high-energy electron from PSII is passed to an ETS, which generates a proton motive force for ATP synthesis by chemiosmosis, and ultimately replaces the electron lost by the PSI reaction center. The PSI reaction center electron is used to make NADPH. (b) When both ATP and NADPH are required, noncyclic photophosphorylation (in cyanobacteria and plants) provides both. The electron flow described here is referred to as the Z-scheme (shown in yellow in [a]). When the cell’s ATP needs outweigh those for NADPH, cyanobacteria and plants will use only PSI, and its reaction center electron is passed to the ETS to generate a proton motive force used for ATP synthesis.</caption>
