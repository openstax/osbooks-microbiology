<title>Isolation of Viruses</title>
<para id="fs-id1168328321538">Unlike bacteria, many of which can be grown on an artificial nutrient medium, viruses require a living host cell for replication. Infected host cells (eukaryotic or prokaryotic) can be cultured and grown, and then the growth medium can be harvested as a source of virus. Virions in the liquid medium can be separated from the host cells by either centrifugation or filtration. Filters can physically remove anything present in the solution that is larger than the virions; the viruses can then be collected in the filtrate (see <link target-id="OSC_Microbio_06_03_filters"/>).</para>

<para id="fs-id1168328312134">Animal viruses require cells within a host animal or tissue-culture cells derived from an animal. Animal virus cultivation is important for 1) identification and diagnosis of pathogenic viruses in clinical specimens, 2) production of vaccines, and 3) basic research studies. In vivo host sources can be a developing embryo in an <term class="no-emphasis" id="term-00005">embryonated bird’s egg</term> (e.g., chicken, turkey) or a whole animal. For example, most of the <term class="no-emphasis" id="term-00006">influenza vaccine</term> manufactured for annual flu vaccination programs is cultured in hens’ eggs.</para>
<para id="fs-id1168328358898">The embryo or host animal serves as an incubator for viral replication (see <link target-id="OSC_Microbio_06_03_egg"/>). Location within the embryo or host animal is important. Many viruses have a tissue tropism, and must therefore be introduced into a specific site for growth. Within an embryo, target sites include the amniotic cavity, the chorioallantoic membrane, or the yolk sac. Viral infection may damage tissue membranes, producing lesions called pox; disrupt embryonic development; or cause the death of the embryo.</para>

<para id="fs-id1168327958664">For in vitro studies, various types of cells can be used to support the growth of viruses. A <term class="no-emphasis" id="term-00007">primary cell culture</term> is freshly prepared from animal organs or tissues. Cells are extracted from tissues by mechanical scraping or mincing to release cells or by an enzymatic method using trypsin or collagenase to break up tissue and release single cells into suspension. Because of anchorage-dependence requirements, primary cell cultures require a liquid culture medium in a Petri dish or tissue-culture flask so cells have a solid surface such as glass or plastic for attachment and growth. Primary cultures usually have a limited life span. When cells in a primary culture undergo mitosis and a sufficient density of cells is produced, cells come in contact with other cells. When this cell-to-cell-contact occurs, mitosis is triggered to stop. This is called <term class="no-emphasis" id="term-00008">contact inhibition</term> and it prevents the density of the cells from becoming too high. To prevent contact inhibition, cells from the primary cell culture must be transferred to another vessel with fresh growth medium. This is called a secondary cell culture. Periodically, cell density must be reduced by pouring off some cells and adding fresh medium to provide space and nutrients to maintain cell growth. In contrast to primary cell cultures, <term class="no-emphasis" id="term-00009">continuous cell line</term>s, usually derived from transformed cells or tumors, are often able to be subcultured many times or even grown indefinitely (in which case they are called immortal). Continuous cell lines may not exhibit <term class="no-emphasis" id="term-00010">anchorage dependency</term> (they will grow in suspension) and may have lost their contact inhibition. As a result, continuous cell lines can grow in piles or lumps resembling small tumor growths (see <link target-id="OSC_Microbio_06_03_cult"/>).</para>

<media id="fs-id1168328070284" alt="Figure a begins with induvial cells isolated from lung tissue. These few cells are put on a plate and are the primary cell culture. These cells will grow to fill the plate and will stop when the plate is full; this is called contact inhibition. In order to grow more cells some of these cells are transferred to a new plate; this is now called a secondary cell culture. Figure b begins with transformed cells or individual cells isolated from a tumor that are put on a plate. These cells form a continuous culture because they continue to grow on top of each other even after the plate is full.">

<caption>Cells for culture are prepared by separating them from their tissue matrix. (a) Primary cell cultures grow attached to the surface of the culture container. Contact inhibition slows the growth of the cells once they become too dense and begin touching each other. At this point, growth can only be sustained by making a secondary culture. (b) Continuous cell cultures are not affected by contact inhibition. They continue to grow regardless of cell density.

<para id="fs-id1168328065842">An example of an immortal cell line is the <term class="no-emphasis" id="term-00011">HeLa cell line</term>, which was originally cultivated from tumor cells obtained from Henrietta <term class="no-emphasis" id="term-00012">Lacks</term>, a patient who died of cervical cancer in 1951. HeLa cells were the first continuous tissue-culture cell line and were used to establish tissue culture as an important technology for research in cell biology, virology, and medicine.

<title>The Immortal Cell Line of Henrietta Lacks</title>
<para id="fs-id1168327873992">In January 1951, Henrietta <term class="no-emphasis" id="term-00013">Lacks</term>, a 30-year-old African American woman from Baltimore, was diagnosed with cervical cancer at Johns Hopkins Hospital. We now know her cancer was caused by the human papillomavirus (HPV). Cytopathic effects of the virus altered the characteristics of her cells in a process called transformation, which gives the cells the ability to divide continuously. This ability, of course, resulted in a cancerous tumor that eventually killed Mrs. Lacks in October at age 31. Before her death, samples of her cancerous cells were taken without her knowledge or permission. The samples eventually ended up in the possession of Dr. George Gey, a biomedical researcher at Johns Hopkins University. Gey was able to grow some of the cells from Lacks’s sample, creating what is known today as the immortal <term class="no-emphasis" id="term-00014">HeLa cell line</term>. These cells have the ability to live and grow indefinitely and, even today, are still widely used in many areas of research.</para>
<para id="fs-id1168327884140">According to Lacks’s husband, neither Henrietta nor the family gave the hospital permission to collect her tissue specimen. Indeed, the family was not aware until 20 years after Lacks’s death that her cells were still alive and actively being used for commercial and research purposes. Yet HeLa cells have been pivotal in numerous research discoveries related to polio, cancer, and AIDS, among other diseases. The cells have also been commercialized, although they have never themselves been patented. Despite this, Henrietta Lacks’s estate has never benefited from the use of the cells, although, in 2013, the Lacks family was given control over the publication of the genetic sequence of her cells. In 2023, her family reached a settlement with biotech company Thermo Fisher, whom they had sued for knowingly profiting from the cell line without compensating the Lacks family.</para>
<para id="fs-id1168328304141">This case raises several bioethical issues surrounding patients’ informed consent and the right to know. At the time Lacks’s tissues were taken, there were no laws or guidelines about informed consent. Does that mean she was treated fairly at the time? Certainly by today’s standards, the answer would be no. Harvesting tissue or organs from a dying patient without consent is not only considered unethical but illegal, regardless of whether such an act could save other patients’ lives. Is it ethical, then, for scientists to continue to use Lacks’s tissues for research, even though they were obtained illegally by today’s standards?</para>
<para id="fs-id1168328190055">Ethical or not, Lacks’s cells are widely used today for so many applications that it is impossible to list them all. Is this a case in which the ends justify the means? Would Lacks be pleased to know about her contribution to science and the millions of people who have benefited? Would she want her family to be compensated for the commercial products that have been developed using her cells? Or would she feel violated and exploited by the researchers who took part of her body without her consent? Because she was never asked, we will never know.</para>

<title>Hemagglutination Assay</title>
<para id="fs-id1168327958832">A serological assay is used to detect the presence of certain types of viruses in patient serum. Serum is the straw-colored liquid fraction of blood plasma from which clotting factors have been removed. Serum can be used in a direct assay called a <term class="no-emphasis" id="term-00016">hemagglutination assay</term> to detect specific types of viruses in the patient’s sample. Hemagglutination is the agglutination (clumping) together of erythrocytes (red blood cells). Many viruses produce surface proteins or spikes called hemagglutinins that can bind to receptors on the membranes of erythrocytes and cause the cells to agglutinate. Hemagglutination is observable without using the microscope, but this method does not always differentiate between infectious and noninfectious viral particles, since both can agglutinate erythrocytes.</para>
<para id="fs-id1168328168830">To identify a specific pathogenic virus using hemagglutination, we must use an indirect approach. Proteins called antibodies, generated by the patient’s immune system to fight a specific virus, can be used to bind to components such as hemagglutinins that are uniquely associated with specific types of viruses. The binding of the antibodies with the hemagglutinins found on the virus subsequently prevent erythrocytes from directly interacting with the virus. So when erythrocytes are added to the antibody-coated viruses, there is no appearance of agglutination; agglutination has been inhibited. We call these types of indirect assays for virus-specific antibodies <term class="no-emphasis" id="term-00017">hemagglutination inhibition (HAI) assays</term>. HAI can be used to detect the presence of antibodies specific to many types of viruses that may be causing or have caused an infection in a patient even months or years after infection (see <link target-id="OSC_Microbio_06_03_agglutin"/>). This assay is described in greater detail in <link document="m58902">Agglutination Assays</link>.</para>

<title>Enzyme Immunoassay</title>
<para id="fs-id1168327962426"><term class="no-emphasis" id="term-00022">Enzyme immunoassays (EIAs)</term> rely on the ability of antibodies to detect and attach to specific biomolecules called antigens. The detecting antibody attaches to the target antigen with a high degree of specificity in what might be a complex mixture of biomolecules. Also included in this type of assay is a colorless enzyme attached to the detecting antibody. The enzyme acts as a tag on the detecting antibody and can interact with a colorless substrate, leading to the production of a colored end product. EIAs often rely on layers of antibodies to capture and react with antigens, all of which are attached to a membrane filter (see <link target-id="OSC_Microbio_06_03_EIA"/>). EIAs for viral antigens are often used as preliminary screening tests. If the results are positive, further confirmation will require tests with even greater sensitivity, such as a <term class="no-emphasis" id="term-00023">western blot</term> or an <term class="no-emphasis" id="term-00024">NAAT</term>.
