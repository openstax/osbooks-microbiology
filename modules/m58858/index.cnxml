<para id="fs-id1167661325378">Most people associate the term <term class="no-emphasis" id="term-00001">chemotherapy</term> with treatments for cancer. However, chemotherapy is actually a broader term that refers to any use of chemicals or drugs to treat disease. Chemotherapy may involve drugs that target cancerous cells or tissues, or it may involve <term id="term-00002">antimicrobial drugs</term> that target infectious microorganisms. Antimicrobial drugs typically work by destroying or interfering with microbial structures and enzymes, either killing microbial cells or inhibiting their growth. But before we examine how these drugs work, we will briefly explore the history of humans’ use of antimicrobials for the purpose of chemotherapy.</para>

<title>Use of Antimicrobials in Ancient Societies</title>
<para id="fs-id1167663963808">Although the discovery of antimicrobials and their subsequent widespread use is commonly associated with modern medicine, there is evidence that humans have been exposed to antimicrobial compounds for millennia. Chemical analyses of the skeletal remains of people from Nubia<footnote id="fs-id1167663965018">M.L. Nelson et al. “Brief Communication: Mass Spectroscopic Characterization of Tetracycline in the Skeletal Remains of an Ancient Population from Sudanese Nubia 350–550 CE.” <emphasis effect="italics">American Journal of Physical Anthropology</emphasis> 143 no. 1 (2010):151–154. </footnote> (now found in present-day Sudan) dating from between 350 and 550 AD have shown residue of the antimicrobial agent <term class="no-emphasis" id="term-00003">tetracycline</term> in high enough quantities to suggest the purposeful fermentation of tetracycline-producing <emphasis effect="italics">Streptomyces</emphasis> during the beer-making process. The resulting <term class="no-emphasis" id="term-00004">beer</term>, which was thick and gruel-like, was used to treat a variety of ailments in both adults and children, including gum disease and wounds. The antimicrobial properties of certain plants may also have been recognized by various cultures around the world, including Indian and Chinese <term class="no-emphasis" id="term-00005">herbalists</term> (<link target-id="OSC_Microbio_14_01_Woodcut"/>) who have long used plants for a wide variety of medical purposes. More contemporary researchers have utilized practices and even texts from these traditional sources.

<title>The First Antimicrobial Drugs</title>
<para id="fs-id1167661326783">Societies relied on traditional medicine for thousands of years; however, the first half of the 20th century brought an era of strategic drug discovery. In the early 1900s, the German physician and scientist Paul <term class="no-emphasis" id="term-00006">Ehrlich</term> (1854–1915) set out to discover or synthesize chemical compounds capable of killing infectious microbes without harming the patient. In 1909, after screening more than 600 arsenic-containing compounds, Ehrlich’s assistant Sahachiro <term class="no-emphasis" id="term-00007">Hata</term> (1873–1938) found one such “magic bullet.” <term class="no-emphasis" id="term-00008">Compound 606</term> targeted the bacterium <emphasis effect="italics">Treponema pallidum</emphasis>, the causative agent of syphilis. Compound 606 was found to successfully cure syphilis in rabbits and soon after was marketed under the name <term class="no-emphasis" id="term-00009">Salvarsan</term> as a remedy for the disease in humans (<link target-id="OSC_Microbio_14_01_Ehrlich"/>). Ehrlich’s innovative approach of systematically screening a wide variety of compounds remains a common strategy for the discovery of new antimicrobial agents even today.</para>

<caption>Paul Ehrlich was influential in the discovery of Compound 606, an antimicrobial agent that proved to be an effective treatment for syphilis.</caption>
</figure>
<para id="fs-id1167663984604">A few decades later, German scientists Josef <term class="no-emphasis" id="term-00010">Klarer</term>, Fritz <term class="no-emphasis" id="term-00011">Mietzsch</term>, and Gerhard <term class="no-emphasis" id="term-00012">Domagk</term> discovered the antibacterial activity of a synthetic dye, <term class="no-emphasis" id="term-00013">prontosil</term>, that could treat streptococcal and staphylococcal infections in mice. Domagk’s own daughter was one of the first human recipients of the drug, which completely cured her of a severe streptococcal infection that had resulted from a poke with an embroidery needle. Gerhard <term class="no-emphasis" id="term-00014">Domagk</term> (1895–1964) was awarded the Nobel Prize in Medicine in 1939 for his work with prontosil and <term class="no-emphasis" id="term-00015">sulfanilamide</term>, the active breakdown product of prontosil in the body. Sulfanilamide, the first synthetic antimicrobial created, served as the foundation for the chemical development of a family of sulfa drugs. A <term id="term-00016">synthetic antimicrobial</term> is a drug that is developed from a chemical not found in nature. The success of the <term class="no-emphasis" id="term-00017">sulfa drugs</term> led to the discovery and production of additional important classes of synthetic antimicrobials, including the <term class="no-emphasis" id="term-00018">quinolines</term> and <term class="no-emphasis" id="term-00019">oxazolidinones</term>.</para>
<para id="fs-id1167661463241">A few years before the discovery of prontosil, scientist Alexander <term class="no-emphasis" id="term-00020">Fleming</term> (1881–1955) made his own accidental discovery that turned out to be monumental. In 1928, Fleming returned from holiday and examined some old plates of staphylococci in his research laboratory at St. Mary’s Hospital in London. He observed that contaminating mold growth (subsequently identified as a strain of <emphasis effect="italics">Penicillium notatum</emphasis>) inhibited staphylococcal growth on one plate. Fleming, therefore, is credited with the discovery of <term id="term-00021">penicillin</term>, the first <term id="term-00022">natural antibiotic</term>, (<link target-id="OSC_Microbio_14_01_Oxford"/>). Further experimentation showed that penicillin from the mold was antibacterial against streptococci, meningococci, and <term class="no-emphasis" id="term-00023"><emphasis effect="italics">Corynebacterium diphtheriae</emphasis></term>, the causative agent of diphtheria.</para>
<para id="fs-id1167661292885">Fleming and his colleagues were credited with discovering and identifying penicillin, but its isolation and mass production were accomplished by a team of researchers at Oxford University under the direction of Howard <term class="no-emphasis" id="term-00024">Florey</term> (1898–1968) and Ernst <term class="no-emphasis" id="term-00025">Chain</term> (1906–1979) (<link target-id="OSC_Microbio_14_01_Oxford"/>). In 1940, the research team purified penicillin and reported its success as an antimicrobial agent against streptococcal infections in mice. Their subsequent work with human subjects also showed penicillin to be very effective. Because of their important work, Fleming, Florey, and Chain were awarded the Nobel Prize in Physiology and Medicine in 1945.</para>
<para id="fs-id1167663877680">In the early 1940s, scientist Dorothy <term class="no-emphasis" id="term-00026">Hodgkin</term> (1910–1994), who studied crystallography at Oxford University, used X-rays to analyze the structure of a variety of natural products. In 1946, she determined the structure of penicillin, for which she was awarded the Nobel Prize in Chemistry in 1964. Once the structure was understood, scientists could modify it to produce a variety of semisynthetic penicillins. A <term id="term-00027">semisynthetic antimicrobial</term> is a chemically modified derivative of a natural antibiotic. The chemical modifications are generally designed to increase the range of bacteria targeted, increase stability, decrease toxicity, or confer other properties beneficial for treating infections.</para>
<para id="fs-id1167659190135">Penicillin is only one example of a natural antibiotic. Also in the 1940s, Selman <term class="no-emphasis" id="term-00028">Waksman</term> (1888–1973) (<link target-id="OSC_Microbio_14_01_Waksman"/>), a prominent soil microbiologist at Rutgers University, led a research team that discovered several antimicrobials, including <term class="no-emphasis" id="term-00029">actinomycin</term>, <term class="no-emphasis" id="term-00030">streptomycin</term>, and <term class="no-emphasis" id="term-00031">neomycin</term>. The discoveries of these antimicrobials stemmed from Waksman’s study of fungi and the <term class="no-emphasis" id="term-00032">Actinobacteria</term>, including soil bacteria in the genus <emphasis effect="italics">Streptomyces</emphasis>, known for their natural production of a wide variety of antimicrobials. Key collaborators included Arthur Shatz, who first isolated streptomycin, and Elizabeth Bugie, who performed the antibacterial testing for the substance. All three were included on the critical paper about the discovery, but Waksman was noted for playing down the role of his collaborators in later writings and in the patent process. He was given the Nobel Prize in Physiology and Medicine in 1952. The <term class="no-emphasis" id="term-00033">actinomycetes</term> are the source of more than half of all natural antibiotics<footnote id="fs-id1167663742772">J. Berdy. “Bioactive Microbial Metabolites.” <emphasis effect="italics">The Journal of Antibiotics</emphasis> 58 no. 1 (2005):1–26.</footnote> and continue to serve as an excellent reservoir for the discovery of novel antimicrobial agents.
