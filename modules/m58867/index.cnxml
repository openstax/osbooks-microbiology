<caption>The steps for confirming that a pathogen is the cause of a particular disease using Koch’s postulates.</caption>
</figure>
<para id="fs-id1167586273632">In many ways, Koch’s postulates are still central to our current understanding of the causes of disease. However, advances in microbiology have revealed some important limitations in Koch’s criteria. Koch made several assumptions that we now know are untrue in many cases. The first relates to postulate 1, which assumes that pathogens are only found in diseased, not healthy, individuals. This is not true for many pathogens. For example, <emphasis effect="italics">H. pylori</emphasis>, described earlier in this chapter as a pathogen causing chronic gastritis, is also part of the normal microbiota of the stomach in many healthy humans who never develop gastritis. It is estimated that upwards of 50% of the human population acquires <emphasis effect="italics">H. pylori</emphasis> early in life, with most maintaining it as part of the normal microbiota for the rest of their life without ever developing disease. Similarly, when Alice Katherine <term class="no-emphasis" id="term-00078">Evans</term> discovered that <emphasis effect="italics">Brucellis</emphasis> bacteria found in cows was responsible for a common human disease, she noted that the infected cattle could pass on the infection whether or not they displayed symptoms. This is an important distinction: Even without knowledge of microbiology, many people would not consume milk from a visibly sick cow, but the concept of a healthy cow being infectious is critical to understanding the risks posed by pathogens.</para>
<para id="fs-id1167586022361">Koch’s second faulty assumption was that all healthy test subjects are equally susceptible to disease. We now know that individuals are not equally susceptible to disease. Individuals are unique in terms of their microbiota and the state of their immune system at any given time. The makeup of the resident microbiota can influence an individual’s susceptibility to an infection. Members of the normal microbiota play an important role in immunity by inhibiting the growth of transient pathogens. In some cases, the microbiota may prevent a pathogen from establishing an infection; in others, it may not prevent an infection altogether but may influence the severity or type of signs and symptoms. As a result, two individuals with the same disease may not always present with the same signs and symptoms. In addition, some individuals have stronger immune systems than others. Individuals with immune systems weakened by age or an unrelated illness are much more susceptible to certain infections than individuals with strong immune systems.</para>
<para id="fs-id1167586258336">Koch also assumed that all pathogens are microorganisms that can be grown in pure culture (postulate 2) and that animals could serve as reliable models for human disease. However, we now know that not all pathogens can be grown in pure culture, and many human diseases cannot be reliably replicated in animal hosts. Viruses and certain bacteria, including <term class="no-emphasis" id="term-00002"><emphasis effect="italics">Rickettsia</emphasis></term> and <term class="no-emphasis" id="term-00003"><emphasis effect="italics">Chlamydia</emphasis></term>, are obligate intracellular pathogens that can grow only when inside a host cell. If a microbe cannot be cultured, a researcher cannot move past postulate 2. Likewise, without a suitable nonhuman host, a researcher cannot evaluate postulate 3 without deliberately infecting humans, which presents obvious ethical concerns. AIDS is an example of such a disease because the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) only causes disease in humans.</para>

<title>Molecular Koch’s Postulates</title>
<para id="fs-id1167586009072">In 1988, Stanley <term class="no-emphasis" id="term-00004">Falkow</term> (1934–) proposed a revised form of Koch’s postulates known as <term class="no-emphasis" id="term-00005">molecular Koch’s postulates</term>. These are listed in the left column of <link target-id="fs-id1167582747952"/>. The premise for molecular Koch’s postulates is not in the ability to isolate a particular pathogen but rather to identify a gene that may cause the organism to be pathogenic.</para>
<para id="fs-id1167582784227">Falkow’s modifications to Koch’s original postulates explain not only infections caused by intracellular pathogens but also the existence of pathogenic strains of organisms that are usually nonpathogenic. For example, the predominant form of the bacterium <term class="no-emphasis" id="term-00006"><emphasis effect="italics">Escherichia coli</emphasis></term> is a member of the normal microbiota of the human intestine and is generally considered harmless. However, there are pathogenic strains of <emphasis effect="italics">E. coli</emphasis> such as enterotoxigenic <emphasis effect="italics">E. coli</emphasis> (<term class="no-emphasis" id="term-00007">ETEC</term>) and <term class="no-emphasis" id="term-00008">enterohemorrhagic <emphasis effect="italics">E. coli</emphasis> (O157:H7)</term> (EHEC). We now know ETEC and <term class="no-emphasis" id="term-00009">EHEC</term> exist because of the acquisition of new genes by the once-harmless <emphasis effect="italics">E. coli</emphasis>, which, in the form of these pathogenic strains, is now capable of producing toxins and causing illness. The pathogenic forms resulted from minor genetic changes. The right-side column of <link target-id="fs-id1167582747952"/> illustrates how molecular Koch’s postulates can be applied to identify EHEC as a pathogenic bacterium.</para>

(2) Inactivation of the suspected gene(s) associated with pathogenicity should result in a measurable loss of pathogenicity.

<title>Pathogenicity and Virulence</title>
<para id="fs-id1167582708118">The ability of a microbial agent to cause disease is called <term id="term-00010">pathogenicity</term>, and the degree to which an organism is pathogenic is called <term id="term-00011">virulence</term>. Virulence is a continuum. On one end of the spectrum are organisms that are avirulent (not harmful) and on the other are organisms that are highly virulent. Highly virulent pathogens will almost always lead to a disease state when introduced to the body, and some may even cause multi-organ and body system failure in healthy individuals. Less virulent pathogens may cause an initial infection, but may not always cause severe illness. Pathogens with low virulence would more likely result in mild signs and symptoms of disease, such as low-grade fever, headache, or muscle aches. Some individuals might even be asymptomatic.</para>
<para id="fs-id1167586274523">An example of a highly virulent microorganism is <term class="no-emphasis" id="term-00012"><emphasis effect="italics">Bacillus anthracis</emphasis></term>, the pathogen responsible for <term class="no-emphasis" id="term-00013">anthrax</term>. <emphasis effect="italics">B. anthracis</emphasis> can produce different forms of disease, depending on the route of transmission (e.g., cutaneous injection, inhalation, ingestion). The most serious form of anthrax is inhalation anthrax. After <emphasis effect="italics">B. anthracis</emphasis> spores are inhaled, they germinate. An active infection develops and the bacteria release potent toxins that cause edema (fluid buildup in tissues), hypoxia (a condition preventing oxygen from reaching tissues), and necrosis (cell death and inflammation). Signs and symptoms of inhalation anthrax include high fever, difficulty breathing, vomiting and coughing up blood, and severe chest pains suggestive of a heart attack. With inhalation anthrax, the toxins and bacteria enter the bloodstream, which can lead to multi-organ failure and death of the patient. If a gene (or genes) involved in pathogenesis is inactivated, the bacteria become less virulent or nonpathogenic.</para>
<para id="fs-id1167582418760">Virulence of a pathogen can be quantified using controlled experiments with laboratory animals. Two important indicators of virulence are the <term id="term-00014">median infectious dose (ID<sub>50</sub>)</term> and the <term id="term-00015">median lethal dose (LD<sub>50</sub>)</term>, both of which are typically determined experimentally using animal models. The <term class="no-emphasis" id="term-00016">ID<sub>50</sub></term> is the number of pathogen cells or virions required to cause active infection in 50% of inoculated animals. The <term class="no-emphasis" id="term-00017">LD<sub>50</sub></term> is the number of pathogenic cells, virions, or amount of toxin required to kill 50% of infected animals. To calculate these values, each group of animals is inoculated with one of a range of known numbers of pathogen cells or virions. In graphs like the one shown in <link target-id="OSC_Microbio_15_02_PopCurve"/>, the percentage of animals that have been infected (for ID<sub>50</sub>) or killed (for LD<sub>50</sub>) is plotted against the concentration of pathogen inoculated. <link target-id="OSC_Microbio_15_02_PopCurve"/> represents data graphed from a hypothetical experiment measuring the LD<sub>50</sub> of a pathogen. Interpretation of the data from this graph indicates that the LD<sub>50</sub> of the pathogen for the test animals is 10<sup>4</sup> pathogen cells or virions (depending upon the pathogen studied).</para>

<para id="fs-id1167582397845"><link target-id="fs-id1167582435824"/> lists selected foodborne pathogens and their ID<sub>50</sub> values in humans (as determined from epidemiologic data and studies on human volunteers). Keep in mind that these are <emphasis effect="italics">median</emphasis> values. The actual infective dose for an individual can vary widely, depending on factors such as route of entry; the age, health, and immune status of the host; and environmental and pathogen-specific factors such as susceptibility to the acidic pH of the stomach. It is also important to note that a pathogen’s infective dose does not necessarily correlate with disease severity. For example, just a single cell of <term class="no-emphasis" id="term-00018"><emphasis effect="italics">Salmonella enterica</emphasis></term> serotype Typhimurium can result in an active infection. The resultant disease, <emphasis effect="italics">Salmonella</emphasis> gastroenteritis or <term class="no-emphasis" id="term-00019">salmonellosis</term>, can cause nausea, vomiting, and diarrhea, but has a mortality rate of less than 1% in healthy adults. In contrast, <emphasis effect="italics">S. enterica</emphasis> serotype Typhi has a much higher ID<sub>50</sub>, typically requiring as many as 1,000 cells to produce infection. However, this serotype causes <term class="no-emphasis" id="term-00020">typhoid fever</term>, a much more systemic and severe disease that has a mortality rate as high as 10% in untreated individuals.</para>

<title>Primary Pathogens versus Opportunistic Pathogens</title>
<para id="fs-id1167582870880">Pathogens can be classified as either primary pathogens or opportunistic pathogens. A <term id="term-00021">primary pathogen</term> can cause disease in a host regardless of the host’s resident microbiota or immune system. An <term id="term-00022">opportunistic pathogen</term>, by contrast, can only cause disease in situations that compromise the host’s defenses, such as the body’s protective barriers, immune system, or normal microbiota. Individuals susceptible to opportunistic infections include the very young, the elderly, people who are pregnant, patients undergoing chemotherapy, people with immunodeficiencies (such as acquired immunodeficiency syndrome [AIDS]), patients who are recovering from surgery, and those who have had a breach of protective barriers (such as a severe wound or burn).</para>
<para id="fs-id1167586027511">An example of a primary pathogen is enterohemorrhagic <emphasis effect="italics">E. coli</emphasis> (<term class="no-emphasis" id="term-00023">EHEC</term>), which produces a virulence factor known as <term class="no-emphasis" id="term-00024">Shiga toxin</term>. This toxin inhibits protein synthesis, leading to severe and bloody diarrhea, inflammation, and renal failure, even in patients with healthy immune systems. <term class="no-emphasis" id="term-00025"><emphasis effect="italics">Staphylococcus epidermidis</emphasis></term>, on the other hand, is an opportunistic pathogen that is among the most frequent causes of nosocomial disease.<footnote id="fs-id1167582727726">M. Otto. “<emphasis effect="italics">Staphylococcus epidermidis</emphasis>--The ‘Accidental’ Pathogen.” <emphasis effect="italics">Nature Reviews Microbiology</emphasis> 7 no. 8 (2009):555–567.</footnote> <emphasis effect="italics">S. epidermidis</emphasis> is a member of the normal microbiota of the skin, where it is generally avirulent. However, in hospitals, it can also grow in biofilms that form on catheters, implants, or other devices that are inserted into the body during surgical procedures. Once inside the body, <emphasis effect="italics">S. epidermidis</emphasis> can cause serious infections such as endocarditis, and it produces virulence factors that promote the persistence of such infections.</para>
<para id="fs-id1167586261674">Other members of the normal microbiota can also cause opportunistic infections under certain conditions. This often occurs when microbes that reside harmlessly in one body location end up in a different body system, where they cause disease. For example, <emphasis effect="italics">E. coli</emphasis> normally found in the large intestine can cause a urinary tract infection if it enters the bladder. This is the leading cause of urinary tract infections among females.</para>
<para id="fs-id1167586013390">Members of the normal microbiota may also cause disease when a shift in the environment of the body leads to overgrowth of a particular microorganism. For example, the yeast <term class="no-emphasis" id="term-00026"><emphasis effect="italics">Candida</emphasis></term> is part of the normal microbiota of the skin, mouth, intestine, and vagina, but its population is kept in check by other organisms of the microbiota. If an individual is taking antibacterial medications, however, bacteria that would normally inhibit the growth of <emphasis effect="italics">Candida</emphasis> can be killed off, leading to a sudden growth in the population of <emphasis effect="italics">Candida</emphasis>, which is not affected by antibacterial medications because it is a fungus. An overgrowth of <emphasis effect="italics">Candida</emphasis> can manifest as <term class="no-emphasis" id="term-00027">oral thrush</term> (growth on mouth, throat, and tongue), a vaginal <term class="no-emphasis" id="term-00028">yeast infection</term>, or <term class="no-emphasis" id="term-00029">cutaneous candidiasis</term>. Other scenarios can also provide opportunities for <emphasis effect="italics">Candida</emphasis> infections. Untreated <term class="no-emphasis" id="term-00030">diabetes</term> can result in a high concentration of glucose in the saliva, which provides an optimal environment for the growth of <emphasis effect="italics">Candida,</emphasis> resulting in thrush. Immunodeficiencies such as those seen in patients with HIV, AIDS, and cancer also lead to higher incidence of thrush. Vaginal yeast infections can result from decreases in estrogen levels during the menstruation or menopause. The amount of glycogen available to lactobacilli in the vagina is controlled by levels of estrogen; when estrogen levels are low, lactobacilli produce less lactic acid. The resultant increase in vaginal pH allows overgrowth of <emphasis effect="italics">Candida</emphasis> in the vagina.</para>

<title>Stages of Pathogenesis</title>
<para id="fs-id1167585988244">To cause disease, a pathogen must successfully achieve four steps or <term class="no-emphasis" id="term-00031">stages of pathogenesis</term>: exposure (contact), adhesion (colonization), invasion, and infection. The pathogen must be able to gain entry to the host, travel to the location where it can establish an infection, evade or overcome the host’s immune response, and cause damage (i.e., disease) to the host. In many cases, the cycle is completed when the pathogen exits the host and is transmitted to a new host.</para>
<section id="fs-id1167585992651">
<title>Exposure</title>
<para id="fs-id1167586266996">An encounter with a potential pathogen is known as <term id="term-00032">exposure</term> or <term id="term-00033">contact</term>. The food we eat and the objects we handle are all ways that we can come into contact with potential pathogens. Yet, not all contacts result in infection and disease. For a pathogen to cause disease, it needs to be able to gain access into host tissue. An anatomic site through which pathogens can pass into host tissue is called a <term id="term-00034">portal of entry</term>. These are locations where the host cells are in direct contact with the external environment. Major portals of entry are identified in <link target-id="OSC_Microbio_15_02_Portal"/> and include the skin, mucous membranes, and parenteral routes.</para>

<caption>Shown are different portals of entry where pathogens can gain access into the body. With the exception of the placenta, which is only present during pregnancy, many of these locations are directly exposed to external environments.</caption>
</figure>
<para id="fs-id1167582765379">Mucosal surfaces are the most important portals of entry for microbes; these include the mucous membranes of the respiratory tract, the gastrointestinal tract, and the genitourinary tract. Although most mucosal surfaces are in the interior of the body, some are contiguous with the external skin at various body openings, including the eyes, nose, mouth, urethra, and anus.</para>
<para id="fs-id1167586182724">Most pathogens are suited to a particular portal of entry. A pathogen’s <term class="no-emphasis" id="term-00035">portal specificity</term> is determined by the organism’s environmental adaptions and by the enzymes and toxins they secrete. The respiratory and gastrointestinal tracts are particularly vulnerable portals of entry because particles that include microorganisms are constantly inhaled or ingested, respectively.</para>
<para id="fs-id1167585843762">Pathogens can also enter through a breach in the protective barriers of the skin and mucous membranes. Pathogens that enter the body in this way are said to enter by the <term id="term-00036">parenteral route</term>. For example, the skin is a good natural barrier to pathogens, but breaks in the skin (e.g., wounds, insect bites, animal bites, needle pricks) can provide a parenteral portal of entry for microorganisms.</para>
<para id="fs-id1167582647744">In pregnant people, the <term class="no-emphasis" id="term-00037">placenta</term> normally prevents microorganisms from passing from the pregnant person to the fetus. However, a few pathogens are capable of crossing the blood-placental barrier. The gram-positive bacterium <term class="no-emphasis" id="term-00038"><emphasis effect="italics">Listeria monocytogenes</emphasis></term>, which causes the foodborne disease listeriosis, is one example that poses a serious risk to the fetus and can sometimes lead to spontaneous abortion.

<title>Adhesion</title>
<para id="fs-id1167582702604">Following the initial exposure, the pathogen adheres at the portal of entry. The term <term id="term-00042">adhesion</term> refers to the capability of pathogenic microbes to attach to the cells of the body using <term class="no-emphasis" id="term-00043">adhesion factors</term>, and different pathogens use various mechanisms to adhere to the cells of host tissues.</para>
<para id="fs-id1167585825629">Molecules (either proteins or carbohydrates) called <term id="term-00044">adhesins</term> are found on the surface of certain pathogens and bind to specific receptors (glycoproteins) on host cells. Adhesins are present on the fimbriae and flagella of bacteria, the cilia of protozoa, and the capsids or membranes of viruses. Protozoans can also use hooks and barbs for adhesion; spike proteins on viruses also enhance viral adhesion. The production of <term class="no-emphasis" id="term-00045">glycocalyces</term> (slime layers and capsules) (<link target-id="OSC_Microbio_15_02_adhesion"/>), with their high sugar and protein content, can also allow certain bacterial pathogens to attach to cells.</para>
<para id="fs-id1167582679341">Biofilm growth can also act as an adhesion factor. A <term class="no-emphasis" id="term-00046">biofilm</term> is a community of bacteria that produce a glycocalyx, known as <term class="no-emphasis" id="term-00047">extrapolymeric substance (EPS)</term>, that allows the biofilm to attach to a surface. Persistent <term class="no-emphasis" id="term-00048"><emphasis effect="italics">Pseudomonas aeruginosa</emphasis></term> infections are common in patients suffering from cystic fibrosis, burn wounds, and middle-ear infections (otitis media) because <emphasis effect="italics">P. aeruginosa</emphasis> produces a biofilm. The EPS allows the bacteria to adhere to the host cells and makes it harder for the host to physically remove the pathogen. The EPS not only allows for attachment but provides protection against the immune system and antibiotic treatments, preventing antibiotics from reaching the bacterial cells within the biofilm. In addition, not all bacteria in a biofilm are rapidly growing; some are in stationary phase. Since antibiotics are most effective against rapidly growing bacteria, portions of bacteria in a biofilm are protected against antibiotics.<footnote id="fs-id1167582858390">D.

<title>Invasion</title>
<para id="fs-id1167586023491">Once adhesion is successful, <term id="term-00049">invasion</term> can proceed. Invasion involves the dissemination of a pathogen throughout local tissues or the body. Pathogens may produce exoenzymes or toxins, which serve as <term class="no-emphasis" id="term-00050">virulence factors</term> that allow them to colonize and damage host tissues as they spread deeper into the body. Pathogens may also produce virulence factors that protect them against immune system defenses.

<para id="fs-id1167582471905">Intracellular pathogens achieve invasion by entering the host’s cells and reproducing. Some are <term class="no-emphasis" id="term-00051">obligate intracellular pathogens</term> (meaning they can only reproduce inside of host cells) and others are <term class="no-emphasis" id="term-00052">facultative intracellular pathogens</term> (meaning they can reproduce either inside or outside of host cells). By entering the host cells, intracellular pathogens are able to evade some mechanisms of the immune system while also exploiting the nutrients in the host cell.</para>
<para id="fs-id1167586053960">Entry to a cell can occur by <term class="no-emphasis" id="term-00053">endocytosis</term>. For most kinds of host cells, pathogens use one of two different mechanisms for endocytosis and entry. One mechanism relies on effector proteins secreted by the pathogen; these effector proteins trigger entry into the host cell. This is the method that <term class="no-emphasis" id="term-00054"><emphasis effect="italics">Salmonella</emphasis></term> and <term class="no-emphasis" id="term-00055"><emphasis effect="italics">Shigella</emphasis></term> use when invading intestinal epithelial cells. When these pathogens come in contact with epithelial cells in the intestine, they secrete effector molecules that cause protrusions of membrane ruffles that bring the bacterial cell in. This process is called <term class="no-emphasis" id="term-00056">membrane ruffling</term>. The second mechanism relies on surface proteins expressed on the pathogen that bind to receptors on the host cell, resulting in entry. For example, <term class="no-emphasis" id="term-00057"><emphasis effect="italics">Yersinia</emphasis></term> <emphasis effect="italics">pseudotuberculosis</emphasis> produces a surface protein known as <term class="no-emphasis" id="term-00058">invasin</term> that binds to beta-1 integrins expressed on the surface of host cells.</para>
<para id="fs-id1167585861740">Some host cells, such as white blood cells and other phagocytes of the immune system, actively endocytose pathogens in a process called phagocytosis. Although phagocytosis allows the pathogen to gain entry to the host cell, in most cases, the host cell kills and degrades the pathogen by using digestive enzymes. Normally, when a pathogen is ingested by a phagocyte, it is enclosed within a phagosome in the cytoplasm; the phagosome fuses with a lysosome to form a phagolysosome, where digestive enzymes kill the pathogen (see <link document="m58880">Pathogen Recognition and Phagocytosis</link>). However, some intracellular pathogens have the ability to survive and multiply within phagocytes. Examples include <term class="no-emphasis" id="term-00059"><emphasis effect="italics">Listeria monocytogenes</emphasis></term> and <term class="no-emphasis" id="term-00060"><emphasis effect="italics">Shigella</emphasis></term>; these bacteria produce proteins that lyse the phagosome before it fuses with the lysosome, allowing the bacteria to escape into the phagocyte’s cytoplasm where they can multiply. Bacteria such as <term class="no-emphasis" id="term-00061"><emphasis effect="italics">Mycobacterium tuberculosis</emphasis></term>, <term class="no-emphasis" id="term-00062"><emphasis effect="italics">Legionella pneumophila</emphasis></term>, and <term class="no-emphasis" id="term-00063"><emphasis effect="italics">Salmonella</emphasis></term> species use a slightly different mechanism to evade being digested by the phagocyte. These bacteria prevent the fusion of the phagosome with the lysosome, thus remaining alive and dividing within the phagosome.</para>

<section id="fs-id1167582505576">
<title>Infection</title>
<para id="fs-id1167582708323">Following invasion, successful multiplication of the pathogen leads to infection. Infections can be described as local, focal, or systemic, depending on the extent of the infection. A <term id="term-00064">local infection</term> is confined to a small area of the body, typically near the portal of entry. For example, a hair follicle infected by <term class="no-emphasis" id="term-00065"><emphasis effect="italics">Staphylococcus aureus</emphasis></term> infection may result in a boil around the site of infection, but the bacterium is largely contained to this small location. Other examples of local infections that involve more extensive tissue involvement include urinary tract infections confined to the bladder or pneumonia confined to the lungs.</para>
<para id="fs-id1167582919226">In a <term id="term-00066">focal infection</term>, a localized pathogen, or the toxins it produces, can spread to a secondary location. For example, a dental hygienist nicking the gum with a sharp tool can lead to a local infection in the gum by <emphasis effect="italics">Streptococcus</emphasis> bacteria of the normal oral microbiota. These <emphasis effect="italics">Streptococcus</emphasis> spp. may then gain access to the bloodstream and make their way to other locations in the body, resulting in a secondary infection.</para>
<para id="fs-id1167582706728">When an infection becomes disseminated throughout the body, we call it a <term id="term-00067">systemic infection</term>. For example, infection by the <term class="no-emphasis" id="term-00068">varicella-zoster virus</term> typically gains entry through a mucous membrane of the upper respiratory system. It then spreads throughout the body, resulting in the classic red skin lesions associated with <term class="no-emphasis" id="term-00069">chickenpox</term>. Since these lesions are not sites of initial infection, they are signs of a systemic infection.</para>
<para id="fs-id1167582707014">Sometimes a <term id="term-00070">primary infection</term>, the initial infection caused by one pathogen, can lead to a <term id="term-00071">secondary infection</term> by another pathogen. For example, the immune system of a patient with a primary infection by <term class="no-emphasis" id="term-00072">HIV</term> becomes compromised, making the patient more susceptible to secondary diseases like oral thrush and others caused by opportunistic pathogens. Similarly, a primary infection by <term class="no-emphasis" id="term-00073">Influenzavirus</term> damages and decreases the defense mechanisms of the lungs, making patients more susceptible to a secondary pneumonia by a bacterial pathogen like <term class="no-emphasis" id="term-00074"><emphasis effect="italics">Haemophilus influenzae</emphasis></term> or <term class="no-emphasis" id="term-00075"><emphasis effect="italics">Streptococcus pneumoniae</emphasis></term>. Some secondary infections can even develop as a result of treatment for a primary infection. Antibiotic therapy targeting the primary pathogen can cause collateral damage to the normal microbiota, creating an opening for opportunistic pathogens (see <link target-id="fs-id1167582689384">Case in Point: A Secondary Yeast Infection</link>).</para>

As with portals of entry, many pathogens are adapted to use a particular portal of exit. Similar to portals of entry, the most common portals of exit include the skin and the respiratory, urogenital, and gastrointestinal tracts. Coughing and sneezing can expel pathogens from the respiratory tract. A single sneeze can send thousands of virus particles into the air. Secretions and excretions can transport pathogens out of other portals of exit. Feces, urine, semen, vaginal secretions, tears, sweat, and shed skin cells can all serve as vehicles for a pathogen to leave the body. Pathogens that rely on insect vectors for transmission exit the body in the blood extracted by a biting insect. Similarly, some pathogens exit the body in blood extracted by needles.</para>
