<para id="fs-id1167661365411">Bacteria can enter the circulatory and lymphatic systems through acute infections or breaches of the skin barrier or mucosa. Breaches may occur through fairly common occurrences, such as insect bites or small wounds. Even the act of tooth brushing, which can cause small ruptures in the gums, may introduce bacteria into the circulatory system. In most cases, the bacteremia that results from such common exposures is transient and remains below the threshold of detection. In severe cases, bacteremia can lead to septicemia with dangerous complications such as toxemia, sepsis, and septic shock. In these situations, it is often the immune response to the infection that results in the clinical signs and symptoms rather than the microbes themselves.</para>

<title>Bacterial Sepsis, Septic and Toxic Shock</title>
<para id="fs-id1167663948952">At low concentrations, pro-inflammatory cytokines such as interleukin 1 (<term class="no-emphasis" id="term-00001">IL-1</term>) and tumor necrosis factor-α (<term class="no-emphasis" id="term-00002">TNF-α</term>) play important roles in the host’s immune defenses. When they circulate systemically in larger amounts, however, the resulting immune response can be life threatening. IL-1 induces <term class="no-emphasis" id="term-00003">vasodilation</term> (widening of blood vessels) and reduces the tight junctions between vascular endothelial cells, leading to widespread <term class="no-emphasis" id="term-00004">edema</term>. As fluids move out of circulation into tissues, blood pressure begins to drop. If left unchecked, the blood pressure can fall below the level necessary to maintain proper kidney and respiratory functions, a condition known as <term id="term-00005">septic shock</term>. In addition, the excessive release of cytokines during the inflammatory response can lead to the formation of <term class="no-emphasis" id="term-00006">blood clot</term>s.

<title>Puerperal Sepsis</title>
<para id="fs-id1167663607521">A type of sepsis called <term id="term-00025">puerperal sepsis</term>, also known as puerperal infection, <term class="no-emphasis" id="term-00026">puerperal fever</term>, or childbed fever, is a nosocomial infection associated with the period of puerperium—the time following childbirth during which the mother’s reproductive system returns to a nonpregnant state. Such infections may originate in the genital tract, breast, urinary tract, or a surgical wound. Initially the infection may be limited to the uterus or other local site of infection, but it can quickly spread, resulting in peritonitis, septicemia, and death. Before the 19th century work of Ignaz <term class="no-emphasis" id="term-00027">Semmelweis</term> and the widespread acceptance of germ theory (see <link document="m58791">Modern Foundations of Cell Theory</link>), puerperal sepsis was a major cause of mortality among new mothers in the first few days following childbirth.</para>
<para id="fs-id1167661442181">Puerperal sepsis is often associated with <emphasis effect="italics">Streptococcus pyogenes</emphasis>, but numerous other bacteria can also be responsible. Examples include gram-positive bacterial (e.g. <emphasis effect="italics">Streptococcus</emphasis> spp., <emphasis effect="italics">Staphylococcus</emphasis> spp., and <emphasis effect="italics">Enterococcus</emphasis> spp.), gram-negative bacteria (e.g. <emphasis effect="italics">Chlamydia</emphasis> spp., <emphasis effect="italics">Escherichia coli</emphasis>, <emphasis effect="italics">Klebsiella</emphasis> spp., and <emphasis effect="italics">Proteus</emphasis> spp.), as well as anaerobes such as <emphasis effect="italics">Peptostreptococcus</emphasis> spp., <emphasis effect="italics">Bacteroides</emphasis> spp., and <emphasis effect="italics">Clostridium</emphasis> spp. In cases caused by <emphasis effect="italics">S. pyogenes</emphasis>, the bacteria attach to host tissues using <term class="no-emphasis" id="term-00028">M protein</term> and produce a carbohydrate capsule to avoid phagocytosis. <emphasis effect="italics">S. pyogenes</emphasis> also produces a variety of <term class="no-emphasis" id="term-00029">exotoxin</term>s, like <term class="no-emphasis" id="term-00030">streptococcal pyrogenic exotoxin</term>s A and B, that are associated with virulence and may function as <term class="no-emphasis" id="term-00031">superantigen</term>s.</para>
<para id="fs-id1167661294673">Diagnosis of puerperal fever is based on the timing and extent of fever and isolation, and identification of the etiologic agent in blood, wound, or urine specimens. Because there are numerous possible causes, antimicrobial susceptibility testing must be used to determine the best antibiotic for treatment. Nosocomial incidence of puerperal fever can be greatly reduced through the use of antiseptics during delivery and strict adherence to handwashing protocols by doctors, midwives, and nurses.</para>

<title>Infectious Arthritis</title>
<para id="fs-id1167661369095">Also called <term id="term-00032">septic arthritis</term>, <term id="term-00033">infectious arthritis</term> can be either an acute or a chronic condition. Infectious arthritis is characterized by inflammation of joint tissues and is most often caused by bacterial pathogens. Most cases of acute infectious arthritis are secondary to bacteremia, with a rapid onset of moderate to severe joint pain and swelling that limits the motion of the affected joint. In adults and young children, the infective pathogen is most often introduced directly through injury, such as a wound or a surgical site, and brought to the joint through the circulatory system. Acute infections may also occur after joint replacement surgery. Acute infectious arthritis often occurs in patients with an immune system impaired by other viral and bacterial infections. <emphasis effect="italics">S. aureus</emphasis> is the most common cause of acute septic arthritis in the general population of adults and young children. <term class="no-emphasis" id="term-00034"><emphasis effect="italics">Neisseria gonorrhoeae</emphasis></term> is an important cause of acute infectious arthritis in sexually active individuals.</para>
<para id="fs-id1167663906624">Chronic infectious arthritis is responsible for 5% of all infectious arthritis cases and is more likely to occur in patients with other illnesses or conditions. Patients at risk include those who have an <term class="no-emphasis" id="term-00035">HIV</term> infection, a bacterial or fungal infection, prosthetic joints, <term class="no-emphasis" id="term-00036">rheumatoid arthritis</term> (RA), or who are undergoing immunosuppressive <term class="no-emphasis" id="term-00037">chemotherapy</term>. Onset is often in a single joint; there may be little or no pain, aching pain that may be mild, gradual swelling, mild warmth, and minimal or no redness of the joint area.</para>
<para id="fs-id1167663610677">Diagnosis of infectious arthritis requires the aspiration of a small quantity of synovial fluid from the afflicted joint. Direct microscopic evaluation, culture, antimicrobial susceptibility testing, and polymerase chain reaction (<term class="no-emphasis" id="term-00038">PCR</term>) analyses of the synovial fluid are used to identify the potential pathogen. Typical treatment includes administration of appropriate antimicrobial drugs based on antimicrobial susceptibility testing. For nondrug-resistant bacterial strains, β-lactams such as <term class="no-emphasis" id="term-00039">oxacillin</term> and <term class="no-emphasis" id="term-00040">cefazolin</term> are often prescribed for staphylococcal infections. Third-generation cephalosporins (e.g., <term class="no-emphasis" id="term-00041">ceftriaxone</term>) are used for increasingly prevalent β-lactam-resistant <emphasis effect="italics">Neisseria</emphasis> infections. Infections by <emphasis effect="italics">Mycobacterium</emphasis> spp. or fungi are treated with appropriate long-term antimicrobial therapy. Even with treatment, the prognosis is often poor for those infected.

<title>Osteomyelitis</title>
<para id="fs-id1167661432176">Osteomyelitis is an inflammation of bone tissues most commonly caused by infection. These infections can either be acute or chronic and can involve a variety of different bacteria. The most common causative agent of <term id="term-00042">osteomyelitis</term> is <emphasis effect="italics">S. aureus</emphasis>.

In adults, bacteria usually gain direct access to the bone tissues through trauma or a surgical procedure involving <term class="no-emphasis" id="term-00043">prosthetic joints</term>. In children, the bacteria are often introduced from the bloodstream, possibly spreading from focal infections. The long bones, such as the femur, are more commonly affected in children because of the more extensive vascularization of bones in the young.<footnote id="fs-id1167661733008">M.

<para id="fs-id1167663649177">The signs and symptoms of osteomyelitis include fever, localized pain, swelling due to edema, and ulcers in soft tissues near the site of infection. The resulting inflammation can lead to tissue damage and bone loss. In addition, the infection may spread to joints, resulting in infectious arthritis, or disseminate into the blood, resulting in <term class="no-emphasis" id="term-00044">sepsis</term> and <term class="no-emphasis" id="term-00045">thrombosis</term> (formation of blood clots). Like septic arthritis, osteomyelitis is usually diagnosed using a combination of radiography, imaging, and identification of bacteria from blood cultures, or from bone cultures if blood cultures are negative. Parenteral antibiotic therapy is typically used to treat osteomyelitis. Because of the number of different possible etiologic agents, however, a variety of drugs might be used. Broad-spectrum antibacterial drugs such as <term class="no-emphasis" id="term-00046">nafcillin</term>, <term class="no-emphasis" id="term-00047">oxacillin</term>, or <term class="no-emphasis" id="term-00048">cephalosporin</term> are typically prescribed for acute osteomyelitis, and <term class="no-emphasis" id="term-00049">ampicillin</term> and <term class="no-emphasis" id="term-00050">piperacillin/tazobactam</term> for chronic osteomyelitis. In cases of antibiotic resistance, <term class="no-emphasis" id="term-00051">vancomycin</term> treatment is sometimes required to control the infection.

However, this microbe can also cause nonsuppurative sequelae in the form of acute <term id="term-00054">rheumatic fever</term> (ARF), which can lead to rheumatic heart disease, thus impacting the circulatory system. Rheumatic fever occurs primarily in children a minimum of 2–3 weeks after an episode of untreated or inadequately treated pharyngitis (see <link document="m58913">Bacterial Infections of the Respiratory Tract</link>). At one time, rheumatic fever was a major killer of children in the US; today, however, it is rare in the US because of early diagnosis and treatment of streptococcal pharyngitis with antibiotics.

<title>Gas Gangrene</title>
<para id="fs-id1167661539294">Traumatic injuries or certain medical conditions, such as diabetes, can cause damage to blood vessels that interrupts blood flow to a region of the body. When blood flow is interrupted, tissues begin to die, creating an anaerobic environment in which anaerobic bacteria can thrive. This condition is called <term class="no-emphasis" id="term-00073">ischemia</term>. Endospores of the anaerobic bacterium <term class="no-emphasis" id="term-00074"><emphasis effect="italics">Clostridium perfringens</emphasis></term> (along with a number of other <emphasis effect="italics">Clostridium</emphasis> spp. from the gut) can readily germinate in ischemic tissues and colonize the anaerobic tissues.</para>
<para id="fs-id1167661443407">The resulting infection, called <term id="term-00075">gas gangrene</term>, is characterized by rapidly spreading myonecrosis (death of muscle tissue). The patient experiences a sudden onset of excruciating pain at the infection site and the rapid development of a foul-smelling wound containing gas bubbles and a thin, yellowish discharge tinged with a small amount of blood. As the infection progresses, edema and cutaneous blisters containing bluish-purple fluid form. The infected tissue becomes liquefied and begins sloughing off. The margin between necrotic and healthy tissue often advances several inches per hour even with antibiotic therapy. Septic shock and organ failure frequently accompany gas gangrene; when patients develop sepsis, the mortality rate is greater than 50%.</para>

The gas associated with gas gangrene is produced by <emphasis effect="italics">Clostridium</emphasis>’s fermentation of butyric acid, which produces hydrogen and carbon dioxide that are released as the bacteria multiply, forming pockets of gas in tissues (<link target-id="OSC_Microbio_25_02_Gangrene"/>).</para>
<para id="fs-id1167663968660">Gas gangrene is initially diagnosed based on the presence of the clinical signs and symptoms described earlier in this section. Diagnosis can be confirmed through Gram stain and anaerobic cultivation of wound exudate (drainage) and tissue samples on blood agar. Treatment typically involves surgical debridement of any necrotic tissue; advanced cases may require <term class="no-emphasis" id="term-00078">amputation</term>. Surgeons may also use <term class="no-emphasis" id="term-00079">vacuum-assisted closure (VAC)</term>, a surgical technique in which vacuum-assisted drainage is used to remove blood or serous fluid from a wound or surgical site to speed recovery.

In patients with suspected infection, acute- and convalescent-phase serum samples are required to confirm an active infection. PCR-based tests can also be used for clinical identification of direct specimens from body fluids or tissues as well as cultured specimens.

<para id="fs-id1167663589187">Species in the genus <term class="no-emphasis" id="term-00086"><emphasis effect="italics">Brucella</emphasis></term> are gram-negative facultative intracellular pathogens that appear as coccobacilli. Several species cause zoonotic infections in animals and humans, four of which have significant human pathogenicity: <emphasis effect="italics">B. abortus</emphasis> from cattle and buffalo, <emphasis effect="italics">B. canis</emphasis> from dogs, <emphasis effect="italics">B. suis</emphasis> from swine, and <emphasis effect="italics">B. melitensis</emphasis> from goats, sheep, and camels. Infections by these pathogens are called brucellosis, also known as undulant fever, “Mediterranean fever,” or “Malta fever.” Alice Katherine Evans first determined that <emphasis effect="italics">Brucella</emphasis> infections present in cows could be transmitted to humans through milk. Her findings were disputed for years before being accepted; people began pasteurizing milk (heating it to interfere with microorganisms), which led to a sharp reduction in the related diseases. Vaccination of animals has made brucellosis a rare disease in the US, but it is still common in the Mediterranean, south and central Asia, Central and South America, and the Caribbean. Human infections are primarily associated with the ingestion of meat or unpasteurized dairy products from infected animals. Infection can also occur through inhalation of bacteria in aerosols when handling animal products, or through direct contact with skin wounds. In the US, most cases of brucellosis are found in individuals with extensive exposure to potentially infected animals (e.g., slaughterhouse workers, veterinarians).</para>
<para id="fs-id1167661280959">Two important virulence factors produced by <emphasis effect="italics">Brucella</emphasis> spp. are <term class="no-emphasis" id="term-00087">urease</term>, which allows ingested bacteria to avoid destruction by stomach acid, and lipopolysaccharide (<term class="no-emphasis" id="term-00088">LPS</term>), which allows the bacteria to survive within phagocytes. After gaining entry to tissues, the bacteria are phagocytized by host neutrophils and macrophages. The bacteria then escape from the phagosome and grow within the cytoplasm of the cell. Bacteria phagocytized by macrophages are disseminated throughout the body. This results in the formation of granulomas within many body sites, including bone, liver, spleen, lung, genitourinary tract, brain, heart, eye, and skin. Acute infections can result in undulant (relapsing) fever, but untreated infections develop into chronic disease that usually manifests as acute febrile illness (fever of 40–41 °C [104–105.8 °F]) with recurring flu-like signs and symptoms.</para>

The bacteria then migrate to the nearest lymph nodes, where they cause swelling and pain. Signs and symptoms may also include fever, chills, and fatigue. Most infections are mild and tend to be self-limiting. However, immunocompromised patients may develop <term class="no-emphasis" id="term-00098">bacillary angiomatosis</term> (BA), characterized by the proliferation of blood vessels, resulting in the formation of tumor-like masses in the skin and internal organs; or <term class="no-emphasis" id="term-00099">bacillary peliosis</term> (BP), characterized by multiple cyst-like, blood-filled cavities in the liver and spleen.

This bacterium causes acute febrile disease in animals, usually rodents or other small mammals, and humans. The disease is associated with a high mortality rate if left untreated. Historically, <emphasis effect="italics">Y. pestis</emphasis> has been responsible for several devastating pandemics, resulting in millions of deaths (see <link target-id="fs-id1167661462456">Micro Connections: The History of the Plague</link>).

These forms are differentiated by the mode of transmission and the initial site of infection. <link target-id="OSC_Microbio_25_02_PlagueTran"/> illustrates these various modes of transmission and infection between animals and humans.</para>
<para id="fs-id1167661367903">In bubonic plague, <emphasis effect="italics">Y. pestis</emphasis> is transferred by the bite of infected fleas. Since most flea bites occur on the legs and ankles, <emphasis effect="italics">Y. pestis</emphasis> is often introduced into the tissues and blood circulation in the lower extremities. After a 2- to 6-day incubation period, patients experience an abrupt onset fever (39.5–41 °C [103.1–105.8 °F]), headache, hypotension, and chills. The pathogen localizes in <term class="no-emphasis" id="term-00115">lymph nodes</term>, where it causes inflammation, swelling, and hemorrhaging that results in purple buboes (<link target-id="OSC_Microbio_25_02_Necrosis"/>). Buboes often form in lymph nodes of the groin first because these are the nodes associated with the lower limbs; eventually, through circulation in the blood and lymph, lymph nodes throughout the body become infected and form buboes. The average mortality rate for bubonic plague is about 55% if untreated and about 10% with antibiotic treatment.</para>
<para id="fs-id1167663992682">Septicemic plague occurs when <emphasis effect="italics">Y. pestis</emphasis> is directly introduced into the bloodstream through a cut or wound and circulates through the body. The incubation period for septicemic plague is 1 to 3 days, after which patients develop fever, chills, extreme weakness, abdominal pain, and shock. Disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC) can also occur, resulting in the formation of <term class="no-emphasis" id="term-00116">thrombi</term> that obstruct blood vessels and promote <term class="no-emphasis" id="term-00117">ischemia</term> and <term class="no-emphasis" id="term-00118">necrosis</term> in surrounding tissues (<link target-id="OSC_Microbio_25_02_Necrosis"/>). Necrosis occurs most commonly in extremities such as fingers and toes, which become blackened. Septicemic plague can quickly lead to death, with a mortality rate near 100% when it is untreated.

After an incubation period of 1 to 3 days, signs and symptoms include fever, headache, weakness, and a rapidly developing pneumonia with shortness of breath, chest pain, and cough producing bloody or watery mucus. The pneumonia may result in rapid respiratory failure and shock. Pneumonic plague is the only form of plague that can be spread from person to person by infectious aerosol droplet.

<caption><emphasis effect="italics">Yersinia pestis</emphasis>, the causative agent of plague, has numerous modes of transmission. The modes are divided into two ecological classes: urban and sylvatic (i.e., forest or rural). The urban cycle primarily involves transmission from infected urban mammals (rats) to humans by flea vectors (brown arrows). The disease may travel between urban centers (purple arrow) if infected rats find their way onto ships or trains. The sylvatic cycle involves mammals more common in nonurban environments. Sylvatic birds and mammals (including humans) may become infected after eating infected mammals (pink arrows) or by flea vectors.

<title>The History of the Plague</title>
<para id="fs-id1167661617220">The first recorded pandemic of plague, the <term class="no-emphasis" id="term-00125">Justinian plague</term>, occurred in the sixth century CE. It is thought to have originated in central Africa and spread to the Mediterranean through trade routes. At its peak, more than 5,000 people died per day in Constantinople alone. Ultimately, one-third of that city’s population succumbed to plague.<footnote id="fs-id1167661289187">Rosen, William. Justinian’s Flea: Plague, Empire, and the Birth of Europe.

<para id="fs-id1167661298174">The second major pandemic, dubbed the <term class="no-emphasis" id="term-00126">Black Death</term>, occurred during the 14th century. This time, the infections are thought to have originated somewhere in Asia before being transported to Europe by trade, soldiers, and war refugees. This outbreak killed an estimated one-quarter of the population of Europe (25 million, primarily in major cities). In addition, at least another 25 million are thought to have been killed in Asia and Africa.<footnote id="fs-id1167661433508">Benedictow, Ole J. 2004. The Black Death 1346-1353: The Complete History.

The etiologic agent of plague was discovered by Alexandre Yersin (1863–1943) during this outbreak as well. The overall number of deaths was lower than in prior outbreaks, perhaps because of improved sanitation and medical support.<footnote id="fs-id1167663986761">Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. “Plague: History.” http://www.cdc.gov/plague/history/.

<title>Tick Tips</title>
<para id="fs-id1167661365384">Many of the diseases covered in this chapter involve arthropod vectors. Of these, <term class="no-emphasis" id="term-00175">ticks</term> are probably the most commonly encountered in the US. Adult ticks have eight legs and two body segments, the cephalothorax and the head (<link target-id="OSC_Microbio_25_02_TickTips"/>). They typically range from 2 mm to 4 mm in length, and feed on the blood of the host by attaching themselves to the skin.</para>
<para id="fs-id1167663937738">Unattached ticks should be removed and eliminated as soon as they are discovered. When removing a tick that has already attached itself, keep the following guidelines in mind to reduce the chances of exposure to pathogens:</para>
<list id="fs-id1167661562447" list-type="bulleted" bullet-style="bullet">
<item>Use blunt tweezers to gently pull near the site of attachment until the tick releases its hold on the skin.</item>
<item>Avoid crushing the tick's body and do not handle the tick with bare fingers. This could release bacterial pathogens and actually increase your exposure. The tick can be killed by drowning in water or alcohol, or frozen if it may be needed later for identification and analysis.</item>
<item>Disinfect the area thoroughly by swabbing with an antiseptic such as isopropanol.</item>
<item>Monitor the site of the bite for rashes or other signs of infection.</item>
</list>
<para id="fs-id1167661269071">Many ill-advised home remedies for tick removal have become popular in recent years, propagated by social media and pseudojournalism. Health professionals should discourage patients from resorting to any of the following methods, which are NOT recommended:</para>
<list id="fs-id1167661553998" list-type="bulleted" bullet-style="bullet">
<item>using chemicals (e.g., petroleum jelly or fingernail polish) to dislodge an attached tick, because it can cause the tick to release fluid, which can increase the chance of infection</item>
<item>using hot objects (matches or cigarette butts) to dislodge an attached tick</item>
<item>squeezing the tick's body with fingers or tweezers</item>

<title>Bacterial Infections of the Circulatory and Lymphatic Systems</title>
<para id="fs-id1167663644972">Although the circulatory system is a closed system, bacteria can enter the bloodstream through several routes. Wounds, animal bites, or other breaks in the skin and mucous membranes can result in the rapid dissemination of bacterial pathogens throughout the body. Localized infections may also spread to the bloodstream, causing serious and often fatal systemic infections. <link target-id="OSC_Microbio_25_02_BactCircDP_Part1"/> and <link target-id="OSC_Microbio_25_02_BactCircDP_Part2"/> summarize the major characteristics of bacterial infections of the circulatory and lymphatic systems.</para>

<title>Key Concepts and Summary</title>
<list id="fs-id1167663503173" list-type="bulleted" bullet-style="bullet">
<item>Bacterial infections of the circulatory system are almost universally serious. Left untreated, most have high mortality rates.</item>
<item>Bacterial pathogens usually require a breach in the immune defenses to colonize the circulatory system. Most often, this involves a wound or the bite of an arthropod vector, but it can also occur in hospital settings and result in nosocomial infections.</item>
<item><emphasis effect="bold">Sepsis</emphasis> from both gram-negative and gram-positive bacteria<emphasis effect="bold">, puerperal fever, rheumatic fever, endocarditis, gas gangrene, osteomyelitis,</emphasis> and <emphasis effect="bold">toxic shock syndrome</emphasis> are typically a result of injury or introduction of bacteria by medical or surgical intervention.</item>
<item><emphasis effect="bold">Tularemia, brucellosis, cat-scratch fever, rat-bite fever,</emphasis> and <emphasis effect="bold">bubonic plague</emphasis> are zoonotic diseases transmitted by biological vectors</item>
<item><emphasis effect="bold">Ehrlichiosis, anaplasmosis, endemic</emphasis> and <emphasis effect="bold">murine typhus, Rocky Mountain spotted fever, Lyme disease, relapsing fever,</emphasis> and <emphasis effect="bold">trench fever</emphasis> are transmitted by arthropod vectors.</item>
<item>Because their symptoms are so similar to those of other diseases, many bacterial infections of the circulatory system are difficult to diagnose.</item>
<item>Standard antibiotic therapies are effective for the treatment of most bacterial infections of the circulatory system, unless the bacterium is resistant, in which case synergistic treatment may be required.</item>
<item>The systemic immune response to a bacteremia, which involves the release of excessive amounts of cytokines, can sometimes be more damaging to the host than the infection itself.</item>
