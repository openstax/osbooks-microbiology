In <link document="m58818">Microbial Metabolism</link>, we discussed the microbial catabolism of three classes of macromolecules: proteins, lipids and carbohydrates. In this chapter, we will discuss the genetic role of a fourth class of molecules: nucleic acids. Like other macromolecules, <term id="term-00001">nucleic acid</term>s are composed of monomers, called <term id="term-00002">nucleotide</term>s, which are polymerized to form large strands. Each nucleic acid strand contains certain nucleotides that appear in a certain order within the strand, called its <term id="term-00003">base sequence</term>. The base sequence of <term id="term-00004">deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA)</term> is responsible for carrying and retaining the hereditary information in a cell. In <link document="m58839">Mechanisms of Microbial Genetics</link>, we will discuss in detail the ways in which DNA uses its own base sequence to direct its own synthesis, as well as the synthesis of <term class="no-emphasis" id="term-00005">RNA</term> and proteins, which, in turn, gives rise to products with diverse structure and function. In this section, we will discuss the basic structure and function of DNA.</para>

During the polymerization process, deoxynucleotide triphosphates (dNTP) are used. To construct the sugar-phosphate backbone, the two terminal phosphates are released from the dNTP as a pyrophosphate. The resulting strand of nucleic acid has a free phosphate group at the 5ʹ carbon end and a free hydroxyl group at the 3ʹ carbon end. The two unused phosphate groups from the nucleotide triphosphate are released as pyrophosphate during phosphodiester bond formation.

<title>Discovering the Double Helix</title>
<para id="fs-id1172099533999">By the early 1950s, considerable evidence had accumulated indicating that DNA was the genetic material of cells, and now the race was on to discover its three-dimensional structure.

He found that the amount of adenine was very close to equaling the amount of thymine, and the amount of cytosine was very close to equaling the amount of guanine, or A = T and G = C.

<para id="fs-id1172097392072">Alex’s stool sample showed neither blood nor cysts.

To verify the diagnosis and rule out other possibilities, Alex’s physician ordered a diagnostic lab test of his stool sample to look for DNA sequences encoding specific virulence factors of ETEC. The physician instructed Alex to drink lots of fluids to replace what he was losing and discharged him from the hospital.</para>
<para id="fs-id1172099605962">ETEC produces several plasmid-encoded virulence factors that make it pathogenic compared with typical <emphasis effect="italics">E. coli</emphasis>.

<title>Key Concepts and Summary</title>
<list id="fs-id1172099880167" list-type="bulleted" bullet-style="bullet">
<item><emphasis effect="bold">Nucleic acids</emphasis> are composed of <emphasis effect="bold">nucleotides</emphasis>, each of which contains a pentose sugar, a phosphate group, and a <emphasis effect="bold">nitrogenous base</emphasis>. <emphasis effect="bold">Deoxyribonucleotides</emphasis> within DNA contain <emphasis effect="bold">deoxyribose</emphasis> as the pentose sugar.</item>
<item>DNA contains the <emphasis effect="bold">pyrimidines cytosine</emphasis> and <emphasis effect="bold">thymine</emphasis>, and the <emphasis effect="bold">purines</emphasis> <emphasis effect="bold">adenine</emphasis> and <emphasis effect="bold">guanine</emphasis>.</item>
<item><emphasis effect="bold">Nucleotides</emphasis> are linked together by phosphodiester bonds between the 5ʹ phosphate group of one nucleotide and the 3ʹ hydroxyl group of another. A <emphasis effect="bold">nucleic acid strand</emphasis> has a free phosphate group at the 5ʹ end and a free hydroxyl group at the 3ʹ end.</item>
<item>Chargaff discovered that the amount of <emphasis effect="bold">adenine</emphasis> is approximately equal to the amount of <emphasis effect="bold">thymine</emphasis> in DNA, and that the amount of the <emphasis effect="bold">guanine</emphasis> is approximately equal to <emphasis effect="bold">cytosine</emphasis>. These relationships were later determined to be due to complementary base pairing.</item>
<item>Watson and Crick, building on the work of Chargaff, Franklin and Gosling, and Wilkins, proposed the double helix model and base pairing for DNA structure.</item>
<item>DNA is composed of two complementary strands oriented <emphasis effect="bold">antiparallel</emphasis> to each other with the <emphasis effect="bold">phosphodiester backbones</emphasis> on the exterior of the molecule. The nitrogenous bases of each strand face each other and complementary bases hydrogen bond to each other, stabilizing the double helix.</item>
<item>Heat or chemicals can break the hydrogen bonds between complementary bases, denaturing DNA. Cooling or removing chemicals can lead to renaturation or reannealing of DNA by allowing hydrogen bonds to reform between complementary bases.</item>
<item>DNA stores the instructions needed to build and control the cell. This information is transmitted from parent to offspring through <emphasis effect="bold">vertical gene transfer</emphasis>.</item>
