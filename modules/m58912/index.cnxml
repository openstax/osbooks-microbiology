<title>Anatomy of the Upper Respiratory System</title>
<para id="fs-id1167663960494">The <term class="no-emphasis" id="term-00001">respiratory system</term> can be conceptually divided into upper and lower regions at the point of the <term id="term-00002">epiglottis</term>, the structure that seals off the lower respiratory system from the <term id="term-00003">pharynx</term> during swallowing (<link target-id="OSC_Microbio_22_01_UpperResp"/>). The upper respiratory system is in direct contact with the external environment. The nares (or nostrils) are the external openings of the nose that lead back into the <term id="term-00004">nasal cavity</term>, a large air-filled space behind the nares. These anatomical sites constitute the primary opening and first section of the respiratory tract, respectively. The nasal cavity is lined with hairs that trap large particles, like dust and pollen, and prevent their access to deeper tissues. The nasal cavity is also lined with a mucous membrane and Bowman’s glands that produce mucus to help trap particles and microorganisms for removal. The nasal cavity is connected to several other air-filled spaces. The sinuses, a set of four, paired small cavities in the skull, communicate with the nasal cavity through a series of small openings. The <term id="term-00005">nasopharynx</term> is part of the upper throat extending from the posterior nasal cavity. The nasopharynx carries air inhaled through the nose. The middle ear is connected to the nasopharynx through the <term id="term-00006">eustachian tube</term>. The middle ear is separated from the outer ear by the <term id="term-00007">tympanic membrane</term>, or ear drum. And finally, the lacrimal glands drain to the nasal cavity through the <term id="term-00008">nasolacrimal ducts</term> (tear ducts). The open connections between these sites allow microorganisms to move from the nasal cavity to the sinuses, middle ears (and back), and down into the lower respiratory tract from the nasopharynx.</para>
<para id="fs-id1167663736074">The oral cavity is a secondary opening for the respiratory tract. The oral and nasal cavities connect through the fauces to the pharynx, or throat. The pharynx can be divided into three regions: the nasopharynx, the <term id="term-00009">oropharynx</term>, and the <term id="term-00010">laryngopharynx</term>. Air inhaled through the mouth does not pass through the nasopharynx; it proceeds first through the oropharynx and then through the laryngopharynx. The <term id="term-00011">palatine tonsils</term>, which consist of lymphoid tissue, are located within the oropharynx. The laryngopharynx, the last portion of the pharynx, connects to the <term id="term-00012">larynx</term>, which contains the vocal fold (<link target-id="OSC_Microbio_22_01_UpperResp"/>).</para>

<para id="fs-id1167663517274">The lower respiratory system begins below the epiglottis in the larynx or voice box (<link target-id="OSC_Microbio_22_01_LowerResp"/>). The <term id="term-00013">trachea</term>, or windpipe, is a cartilaginous tube extending from the larynx that provides an unobstructed path for air to reach the lungs. The trachea bifurcates into the left and right <term id="term-00014">bronchi</term> as it reaches the lungs. These paths branch repeatedly to form smaller and more extensive networks of tubes, the <term id="term-00015">bronchiole</term>s.

These structures are surrounded by capillary networks and are the site of gas exchange in the respiratory system. Human lungs contain on the order of 400,000,000 alveoli. The outer surface of the lungs is protected with a double-layered pleural membrane.

<title>Signs and Symptoms of Respiratory Infection</title>
<para id="fs-id1167663810595">Microbial diseases of the respiratory system typically result in an acute inflammatory response. These infections can be grouped by the location affected and have names ending in “itis”, which literally means <emphasis effect="italics">inflammation of</emphasis>. For instance, <term id="term-00046">rhinitis</term> is an inflammation of the nasal cavities, often characteristic of the common cold. Rhinitis may also be associated with hay fever allergies or other irritants. Inflammation of the sinuses is called <term id="term-00047">sinusitis</term> inflammation of the ear is called <term id="term-00048">otitis</term>. Otitis media is an inflammation of the middle ear. A variety of microbes can cause <term id="term-00049">pharyngitis</term>, commonly known as a sore throat. An inflammation of the larynx is called <term id="term-00050">laryngitis</term>. The resulting inflammation may interfere with vocal cord function, causing voice loss. When tonsils are inflamed, it is called <term id="term-00051">tonsillitis</term>. Chronic cases of tonsillitis may be treated surgically with tonsillectomy. More rarely, the epiglottis can be infected, a condition called <term id="term-00052">epiglottitis</term>. In the lower respiratory system, the inflammation of the bronchial tubes results in <term id="term-00053">bronchitis</term>. Most serious of all is <term id="term-00054">pneumonia</term>, in which the <term class="no-emphasis" id="term-00055">alveoli</term> in the lungs are infected and become inflamed. Pus and edema accumulate and fill the alveoli with fluids (called consolidations). This reduces the lungs’ ability to exchange gases and often results in a productive cough expelling phlegm and mucus. Cases of pneumonia can range from mild to life-threatening, and remain an important cause of mortality in the very young and very old.</para>

Together, these lead to a dysfunction of the mucociliary escalator effect. The organisms trapped in the mucus are therefore able to colonize the lungs and cause infections rather than being expelled or swallowed.</para>
