<para id="fs-id1167584938040">In the previous section, we explained that some pathogens are more virulent than others. This is due to the unique <term id="term-00001">virulence factor</term><emphasis effect="bold">s</emphasis> produced by individual pathogens, which determine the extent and severity of disease they may cause. A pathogen’s virulence factors are encoded by genes that can be identified using molecular Koch’s postulates. When genes encoding virulence factors are inactivated, virulence in the pathogen is diminished. In this section, we examine various types and specific examples of virulence factors and how they contribute to each step of pathogenesis.</para>

<title>Virulence Factors for Adhesion</title>
<para id="fs-id1167583524706">As discussed in the previous section, the first two steps in pathogenesis are exposure and adhesion. Recall that an adhesin is a protein or glycoprotein found on the surface of a pathogen that attaches to receptors on the host cell. Adhesins are found on bacterial, viral, fungal, and protozoan pathogens. One example of a bacterial adhesin is <term class="no-emphasis" id="term-00002">type 1 fimbrial adhesin</term>, a molecule found on the tips of fimbriae of enterotoxigenic <emphasis effect="italics">E. coli</emphasis> (<term class="no-emphasis" id="term-00003">ETEC</term>). Recall that fimbriae are hairlike protein bristles on the cell surface. Type 1 fimbrial adhesin allows the fimbriae of ETEC cells to attach to the mannose glycans expressed on intestinal epithelial cells. <link target-id="fs-id1167583600393"/> lists common adhesins found in some of the pathogens we have discussed or will be seeing later in this chapter.</para>

<para id="fs-id1167583688625">The presence of bacteria in Michael’s blood is a sign of infection, since blood is normally sterile. There is no indication that the bacteria entered the blood through an injury. Instead, it appears the portal of entry was the gastrointestinal route. Based on Michael’s symptoms, the results of his blood test, and the fact that Michael was the only one in the family to partake of the hot dogs, the physician suspects that Michael is suffering from a case of listeriosis.</para>

Once ingested, these bacteria invade intestinal epithelial cells and translocate to the liver, where they grow inside hepatic cells. Listeriosis is fatal in about one in five normal healthy people, and mortality rates are slightly higher in patients with pre-existing conditions that weaken the immune response. A cluster of virulence genes encoded on a pathogenicity island is responsible for the pathogenicity of <emphasis effect="italics">L. monocytogenes</emphasis>. These genes are regulated by a transcriptional factor known as peptide chain release factor 1 (PrfA). One of the genes regulated by PrfA is <emphasis effect="italics">hyl</emphasis>, which encodes a toxin known as listeriolysin O (LLO), which allows the bacterium to escape vacuoles upon entry into a host cell. A second gene regulated by PrfA is <emphasis effect="italics">actA,</emphasis> which encodes for a surface protein known as actin assembly-inducing protein (ActA). ActA is expressed on the surface of <emphasis effect="italics">Listeria</emphasis> and polymerizes host actin.

<title>Bacterial Exoenzymes and Toxins as Virulence Factors</title>
<para id="fs-id1167584867161">After exposure and adhesion, the next step in pathogenesis is <term class="no-emphasis" id="term-00006">invasion</term>, which can involve enzymes and toxins. Many pathogens achieve invasion by entering the bloodstream, an effective means of dissemination because blood vessels pass close to every cell in the body. The downside of this mechanism of dispersal is that the blood also includes numerous elements of the immune system. Various terms ending in –emia are used to describe the presence of pathogens in the bloodstream. The presence of bacteria in blood is called <term id="term-00007">bacteremia</term>. Bacteremia involving <term class="no-emphasis" id="term-00008">pyogens</term> (pus-forming bacteria) is called <term class="no-emphasis" id="term-00009">pyemia</term>. When viruses are found in the blood, it is called <term id="term-00010">viremia</term>. The term <term id="term-00011">toxemia</term> describes the condition when toxins are found in the blood. If bacteria are both present and multiplying in the blood, this condition is called <term id="term-00012">septicemia</term>.</para>
<para id="fs-id1167583645167">Patients with septicemia are described as <term id="term-00013">septic</term>, which can lead to <term id="term-00014">shock</term>, a life-threatening decrease in blood pressure (systolic pressure &lt;90 mm Hg) that prevents cells and organs from receiving enough oxygen and nutrients. Some bacteria can cause shock through the release of toxins (virulence factors that can cause tissue damage) and lead to low blood pressure. Gram-negative bacteria are engulfed by immune system phagocytes, which then release <term class="no-emphasis" id="term-00015">tumor necrosis factor</term>, a molecule involved in inflammation and fever. Tumor necrosis factor binds to blood capillaries to increase their permeability, allowing fluids to pass out of blood vessels and into tissues, causing swelling, or <term class="no-emphasis" id="term-00016">edema</term> (<link target-id="OSC_Microbio_15_03_Edema"/>). With high concentrations of tumor necrosis factor, the inflammatory reaction is severe and enough fluid is lost from the circulatory system that blood pressure decreases to dangerously low levels. This can have dire consequences because the heart, lungs, and kidneys rely on normal blood pressure for proper function; thus, multi-organ failure, shock, and death can occur.</para>

This strategy is also used by <emphasis effect="italics">S. aureus</emphasis> and other pathogens to degrade and escape webs of extracellular DNA produced by immune system phagocytes to trap the bacteria.</para>
<para id="fs-id1167583561217">Enzymes that degrade the phospholipids of cell membranes are called <term class="no-emphasis" id="term-00023">phospholipases</term>.

The pathogen responsible for <term class="no-emphasis" id="term-00024">anthrax</term>, <emphasis effect="italics">B. anthracis,</emphasis> produces phospholipase C. When <emphasis effect="italics">B. anthracis</emphasis> is ingested by phagocytic cells of the immune system, phospholipase C degrades the membrane of the phagosome before it can fuse with the lysosome, allowing the pathogen to escape into the cytoplasm and multiply. Phospholipases can also target the membrane that encloses the <term class="no-emphasis" id="term-00025">phagosome</term> within phagocytic cells. As described earlier in this chapter, this is the mechanism used by intracellular pathogens such as <emphasis effect="italics">L. monocytogenes</emphasis> and <emphasis effect="italics">Rickettsia</emphasis> to escape the phagosome and multiply within the cytoplasm of phagocytic cells. The role of phospholipases in bacterial virulence is not restricted to phagosomal escape. Many pathogens produce phospholipases that act to degrade cell membranes and cause lysis of target cells. These phospholipases are involved in lysis of red blood cells, white blood cells, and tissue cells.</para>
<para id="fs-id1167584031245">Bacterial pathogens also produce various protein-digesting enzymes, or proteases. Proteases can be classified according to their substrate target (e.g., serine proteases target proteins with the amino acid serine) or if they contain metals in their active site (e.g., zinc metalloproteases contain a zinc ion, which is necessary for enzymatic activity).</para>
<para id="fs-id1167583519928">One example of a protease that contains a metal ion is the exoenzyme <term id="term-00026">collagenase</term>. Collagenase digests collagen, the dominant protein in connective tissue. Collagen can be found in the extracellular matrix, especially near mucosal membranes, blood vessels, nerves, and in the layers of the skin. Similar to hyaluronidase, collagenase allows the pathogen to penetrate and spread through the host tissue by digesting this connective tissue protein. <term id="term-00027">C. perfringens</term> then uses toxins and a phospholipase to cause cellular lysis and necrosis. Once the host cells have died, the bacterium produces gas by fermenting the muscle carbohydrates. The widespread necrosis of tissue and accompanying gas are characteristic of the condition known as <term class="no-emphasis" id="term-00028">gas gangrene</term> (<link target-id="OSC_Microbio_15_03_CollClost"/>).

<title>Toxins</title>
<para id="fs-id1167585001798">In addition to exoenzymes, certain pathogens are able to produce <term id="term-00029">toxin</term><emphasis effect="bold">s</emphasis>, biological poisons that assist in their ability to invade and cause damage to tissues. The ability of a pathogen to produce toxins to cause damage to host cells is called <term id="term-00030">toxigenicity</term>.</para>
<para id="fs-id1167583732258">Toxins can be categorized as endotoxins or exotoxins. The <term class="no-emphasis" id="term-00031">lipopolysaccharide (LPS)</term> found on the outer membrane of gram-negative bacteria is called <term id="term-00032">endotoxin</term> (<link target-id="OSC_Microbio_15_03_LPS"/>). During infection and disease, gram-negative bacterial pathogens release endotoxin either when the cell dies, resulting in the disintegration of the membrane, or when the bacterium undergoes binary fission. The lipid component of endotoxin, <term class="no-emphasis" id="term-00033">lipid A</term>, is responsible for the toxic properties of the LPS molecule. Lipid A is relatively conserved across different genera of gram-negative bacteria; therefore, the toxic properties of lipid A are similar regardless of the gram-negative pathogen. In a manner similar to that of tumor necrosis factor, lipid A triggers the immune system’s inflammatory response (see <link document="m58881">Inflammation and Fever</link>). If the concentration of endotoxin in the body is low, the inflammatory response may provide the host an effective defense against infection; on the other hand, high concentrations of endotoxin in the blood can cause an excessive inflammatory response, leading to a severe drop in blood pressure, multi-organ failure, and death.</para>

</figure>
<para id="fs-id1167583931539">A classic method of detecting endotoxin is by using the <term class="no-emphasis" id="term-00034"><emphasis effect="italics">Limulus</emphasis> amebocyte lysate (LAL) test</term>. In this procedure, the blood cells (amebocytes) of the horseshoe crab (<emphasis effect="italics">Limulus polyphemus</emphasis>) is mixed with a patient’s serum. The amebocytes will react to the presence of any endotoxin. This reaction can be observed either chromogenically (color) or by looking for coagulation (clotting reaction) to occur within the serum. An alternative method that has been used is an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (<term class="no-emphasis" id="term-00035">ELISA</term>) that uses antibodies to detect the presence of endotoxin.</para>
<para id="fs-id1167585012883">Unlike the toxic lipid A of endotoxin, <term id="term-00036">exotoxin</term><emphasis effect="bold">s</emphasis> are protein molecules that are produced by a wide variety of living pathogenic bacteria. Although some gram-negative pathogens produce exotoxins, the majority are produced by gram-positive pathogens. Exotoxins differ from endotoxin in several other key characteristics, summarized in <link target-id="fs-id1167583723954"/>. In contrast to endotoxin, which stimulates a general systemic inflammatory response when released, exotoxins are much more specific in their action and the cells they interact with. Each exotoxin targets specific receptors on specific cells and damages those cells through unique molecular mechanisms. Endotoxin remains stable at high temperatures, and requires heating at 121 °C (250 °F) for 45 minutes to inactivate. By contrast, most exotoxins are heat labile because of their protein structure, and many are denatured (inactivated) at temperatures above 41 °C (106 °F). As discussed earlier, endotoxin can stimulate a lethal inflammatory response at very high concentrations and has a measured <term class="no-emphasis" id="term-00037">LD<sub>50</sub></term> of 0.24 mg/kg.

Three categories: intracellular targeting toxin, membrane-disrupting toxins, and superantigens. Intracellular-targeting toxins have 4 examples. Cholera toxin produced by Vibrio cholera. Mechanism and disease: Activation of adenylate cyclase in intestinal cells, causing increased levels of cyclic adenosine monophosphate (cAMP) and secretion of fluids and electrolytes out of cell, causing diarrhea. Tetanus toxin produced by Clostridium tetani. Mechanism and disease:  Inhibits the release of inhibitory neurotransmitters in the central nervous system, causing spastic paralysis. Botulinum toxin produced by Clostridium botulinum. Mechanism and disease: Inhibits release of the neurotransmitter acetylcholine from neurons, resulting in flaccid paralysis. Diphtheria toxin produced by Corynebacterium diphtheria. Mechanism and disease: Inhibition of protein synthesis, causing cellular death. Membrane disrupting toxins has 6 examples. Streptolysin produced by Streptococcus pyogenes;  Pneumolysin produced by Streptococcus pneumoniae and Alpha-toxin produced by Staphylococcus aureus all have the same mechanism:  Proteins that assemble into pores in cell membranes, disrupting their function and killing the cell. Alpha-toxin produced by Clostridium perfringens, Phospholipase C produced by Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Beta-toxin produced by Staphylococcus aureus have the same mechanism: Phospholipases that degrade cell membrane phospholipids, disrupting membrane function and killing the cell. Superantigens has 3 examples. Toxic shock syndrome toxin produced by Staphylococcus aureus, Streptococcal mitogenic exotoxin produced by Streptococcus pyogenes, and Streptococcal pyrogenic toxins produced by Streptococcus pyogenes. All have the same mechanism: Stimulates excessive activation of immune system cells and release of cytokines (chemical mediators) from immune system cells.

The B component is responsible for the cellular specificity of the toxin and mediates the initial attachment of the toxin to specific cell surface receptors. Once the A-B toxin binds to the host cell, it is brought into the cell by endocytosis and entrapped in a vacuole. The A and B subunits separate as the vacuole acidifies. The A subunit then enters the cell cytoplasm and interferes with the specific internal cellular function that it targets.</para>

<para id="fs-id1167584907940">Cholera toxin is an <term id="term-00044">enterotoxin</term> produced by the gram-negative bacterium <term class="no-emphasis" id="term-00045"><emphasis effect="italics">Vibrio cholerae</emphasis></term> and is composed of one A subunit and five B subunits. The mechanism of action of the <term class="no-emphasis" id="term-00046">cholera toxin</term> is complex. The B subunits bind to receptors on the intestinal epithelial cell of the small intestine. After gaining entry into the cytoplasm of the epithelial cell, the A subunit activates an intracellular G protein. The activated G protein, in turn, leads to the activation of the enzyme adenyl cyclase, which begins to produce an increase in the concentration of cyclic AMP (a secondary messenger molecule). The increased cAMP disrupts the normal physiology of the intestinal epithelial cells and causes them to secrete excessive amounts of fluid and electrolytes into the lumen of the intestinal tract, resulting in severe “rice-water stool” diarrhea characteristic of cholera.</para>
<para id="fs-id1167583564803">Botulinum toxin (also known as <term class="no-emphasis" id="term-00047">botox</term>) is a neurotoxin produced by the gram-positive bacterium <term class="no-emphasis" id="term-00048"><emphasis effect="italics">Clostridium botulinum</emphasis></term>. It is the most acutely toxic substance known to date. The toxin is composed of a light A subunit and heavy protein chain B subunit. The B subunit binds to neurons to allow <term class="no-emphasis" id="term-00049">botulinum toxin</term> to enter the neurons at the neuromuscular junction. The A subunit acts as a protease, cleaving proteins involved in the neuron’s release of <term class="no-emphasis" id="term-00050">acetylcholine</term>, a neurotransmitter molecule. Normally, neurons release acetylcholine to induce muscle fiber contractions. The toxin’s ability to block acetylcholine release results in the inhibition of muscle contractions, leading to muscle relaxation. This has the potential to stop breathing and cause death. Because of its action, low concentrations of botox are used for cosmetic and medical procedures, including the removal of wrinkles and treatment of overactive bladder.</para>

This toxin also has a light A subunit and heavy protein chain B subunit. Unlike botulinum toxin, <term class="no-emphasis" id="term-00053">tetanus</term> toxin binds to inhibitory interneurons, which are responsible for release of the inhibitory neurotransmitters glycine and gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA). Normally, these neurotransmitters bind to neurons at the neuromuscular junction, resulting in the inhibition of acetylcholine release. Tetanus toxin inhibits the release of glycine and GABA from the interneuron, resulting in permanent muscle contraction. The first symptom is typically stiffness of the jaw (lockjaw). Violent muscle spasms in other parts of the body follow, typically culminating with respiratory failure and death. <link target-id="OSC_Microbio_15_03_Neurotoxin"/> shows the actions of both botulinum and tetanus toxins.</para>

The acetylcholine then binds to receptors on the membrane of a muscle cell. The abnormal mechanism – botulinum toxin blocks the release of acetylcholine stopping muscle contraction. Tetanus toxin causes spastic paralysis; uncontrollable muscle contraction. The normal mechanism shows glycine and GABA released from one axon terminal and binding to receptors on another axon terminal. This causes acetylcholine to remain in the vesicles and not bind to the receptors on the muscle cell. In the abnormal mechanism tetanus toxin prevents the release of glycine and GABA. Therefore acetylcholine is released and binds to receptors on the muscle. This prevents the relaxation of muscles.">

<para id="fs-id1167584922138">Membrane-disrupting toxins affect cell membrane function either by forming pores or by disrupting the phospholipid bilayer in host cell membranes.

<title>Virulence Factors for Survival in the Host and Immune Evasion</title>
<para id="fs-id1167583612623">Evading the immune system is also important to invasiveness. Bacteria use a variety of virulence factors to evade <term class="no-emphasis" id="term-00072">phagocytosis</term> by cells of the immune system. For example, many bacteria produce <term class="no-emphasis" id="term-00073">capsules</term>, which are used in adhesion but also aid in immune evasion by preventing ingestion by phagocytes. The composition of the capsule prevents immune cells from being able to adhere and then phagocytose the cell. In addition, the capsule makes the bacterial cell much larger, making it harder for immune cells to engulf the pathogen (<link target-id="OSC_Microbio_15_03_Phago"/>). A notable capsule-producing bacterium is the gram-positive pathogen <term class="no-emphasis" id="term-00074"><emphasis effect="italics">Streptococcus pneumoniae</emphasis></term>, which causes pneumococcal pneumonia, meningitis, septicemia, and other respiratory tract infections. Encapsulated strains of <emphasis effect="italics">S. pneumoniae</emphasis> are more virulent than nonencapsulated strains and are more likely to invade the bloodstream and cause septicemia and meningitis.</para>
<para id="fs-id1167586217939">Some pathogens can also produce proteases to protect themselves against phagocytosis. As described in <link document="m58883">Adaptive Specific Host Defenses</link>, the human immune system produces antibodies that bind to surface molecules found on specific bacteria (e.g., <term class="no-emphasis" id="term-00075">capsules</term>, <term class="no-emphasis" id="term-00076">fimbriae</term>, <term class="no-emphasis" id="term-00077">flagella</term>, <term class="no-emphasis" id="term-00078">LPS</term>). This binding initiates phagocytosis and other mechanisms of antibacterial killing and clearance. Proteases combat antibody-mediated killing and clearance by attacking and digesting the antibody molecules (<link target-id="OSC_Microbio_15_03_Phago"/>).</para>
<para id="fs-id1167586268459">In addition to capsules and proteases, some bacterial pathogens produce other virulence factors that allow them to evade the immune system. The fimbriae of certain species of <emphasis effect="italics">Streptococcus</emphasis> contain <term class="no-emphasis" id="term-00079">M protein</term>, which alters the surface of <emphasis effect="italics">Streptococcus</emphasis> and inhibits phagocytosis by blocking the binding of the complement molecules that assist phagocytes in ingesting bacterial pathogens. The acid-fast bacterium <term class="no-emphasis" id="term-00080"><emphasis effect="italics">Mycobacterium tuberculosis</emphasis></term> (the causative agent of <term class="no-emphasis" id="term-00081">tuberculosis</term>) produces a waxy substance known as <term class="no-emphasis" id="term-00082">mycolic acid</term> in its cell envelope. When it is engulfed by phagocytes in the lung, the protective mycolic acid coat enables the bacterium to resist some of the killing mechanisms within the phagolysosome.</para>

<para id="fs-id1167583581467">Some bacteria produce virulence factors that promote infection by exploiting molecules naturally produced by the host. For example, most strains of <emphasis effect="italics">Staphylococcus aureus</emphasis> produce the exoenzyme <term id="term-00083">coagulase</term>, which exploits the natural mechanism of blood clotting to evade the immune system. Normally, <term class="no-emphasis" id="term-00084">blood clotting</term> is triggered in response to blood vessel damage; platelets begin to plug the clot, and a cascade of reactions occurs in which fibrinogen, a soluble protein made by the liver, is cleaved into <term class="no-emphasis" id="term-00085">fibrin</term>. Fibrin is an insoluble, thread-like protein that binds to blood platelets, cross-links, and contracts to form a mesh of clumped platelets and red blood cells. The resulting clot prevents further loss of blood from the damaged blood vessels. However, if bacteria release coagulase into the bloodstream, the <term class="no-emphasis" id="term-00086">fibrinogen-to-fibrin cascade</term> is triggered in the absence of blood vessel damage. The resulting clot coats the bacteria in fibrin, protecting the bacteria from exposure to phagocytic immune cells circulating in the bloodstream.</para>
<para id="fs-id1167584884884">Whereas coagulase causes blood to clot, <term class="no-emphasis" id="term-00087">kinases</term> have the opposite effect by triggering the conversion of plasminogen to plasmin, which is involved in the digestion of fibrin clots. By digesting a clot, kinases allow pathogens trapped in the clot to escape and spread, similar to the way that collagenase, hyaluronidase, and DNAse facilitate the spread of infection. Examples of kinases include <term class="no-emphasis" id="term-00088">staphylokinases</term> and <term class="no-emphasis" id="term-00089">streptokinases</term>, produced by <term class="no-emphasis" id="term-00090"><emphasis effect="italics">Staphylococcus aureus</emphasis></term> and <term class="no-emphasis" id="term-00091"><emphasis effect="italics">Streptococcus pyogenes</emphasis></term>, respectively. It is intriguing that <emphasis effect="italics">S. aureus</emphasis> can produce both coagulase to promote clotting and staphylokinase to stimulate the digestion of clots. The action of the coagulase provides an important protective barrier from the immune system, but when nutrient supplies are diminished or other conditions signal a need for the pathogen to escape and spread, the production of staphylokinase can initiate this process.</para>
<para id="fs-id1167583598371">A final mechanism that pathogens can use to protect themselves against the immune system is called <term id="term-00092">antigenic variation</term>, which is the alteration of surface proteins so that a pathogen is no longer recognized by the host’s immune system. For example, the bacterium <term class="no-emphasis" id="term-00093"><emphasis effect="italics">Borrelia burgdorferi</emphasis></term>, the causative agent of <term class="no-emphasis" id="term-00094">Lyme disease</term>, contains a surface lipoprotein known as <term class="no-emphasis" id="term-00095">VlsE</term>. Because of genetic recombination during DNA replication and repair, this bacterial protein undergoes antigenic variation. Each time fever occurs, the VlsE protein in <emphasis effect="italics">B. burgdorferi</emphasis> can differ so much that antibodies against previous VlsE sequences are not effective. It is believed that this variation in the VlsE contributes to the ability <emphasis effect="italics">B. burgdorferi</emphasis> to cause chronic disease. Another important human bacterial pathogen that uses antigenic variation to avoid the immune system is <term class="no-emphasis" id="term-00096"><emphasis effect="italics">Neisseria gonorrhoeae</emphasis></term>, which causes the sexually transmitted disease <term class="no-emphasis" id="term-00097">gonorrhea</term>.

<para id="fs-id1167584705073">Based on Michael’s reported symptoms of stiff neck and hemiparesis, the physician suspects that the infection may have spread to his nervous system. The physician decides to order a spinal tap to look for any bacteria that may have invaded the meninges and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF), which would normally be sterile. To perform the spinal tap, Michael’s lower back is swabbed with an iodine antiseptic and then covered with a sterile sheet. The needle is aseptically removed from the manufacturer’s sealed plastic packaging by the clinician’s gloved hands. The needle is inserted and a small volume of fluid is drawn into an attached sample tube. The tube is removed, capped and a prepared label with Michael’s data is affixed to it. This STAT (urgent or immediate analysis required) specimen is divided into three separate sterile tubes, each with 1 mL of CSF. These tubes are immediately taken to the hospital’s lab, where they are analyzed in the clinical chemistry, hematology, and microbiology departments. The preliminary results from all three departments indicate there is a cerebrospinal infection occurring, with the microbiology department reporting the presence of a gram-positive rod in Michael’s CSF.</para>
<para id="fs-id1167582728586">These results confirm what his physician had suspected: Michael’s new symptoms are the result of <term class="no-emphasis" id="term-00098">meningitis</term>, acute inflammation of the membranes that protect the brain and spinal cord. Because meningitis can be life threatening and because the first antibiotic therapy was not effective in preventing the spread of infection, Michael is prescribed an aggressive course of two antibiotics, ampicillin and gentamicin, to be delivered intravenously. Michael remains in the hospital for several days for supportive care and for observation. After a week, he is allowed to return home for bed rest and oral antibiotics. After 3 weeks of this treatment, he makes a full recovery.</para>

<title>Viral Virulence</title>
<para id="fs-id1167583568709">Although viral pathogens are not similar to bacterial pathogens in terms of structure, some of the properties that contribute to their virulence are similar. Viruses use <term class="no-emphasis" id="term-00099">adhesins</term> to facilitate adhesion to host cells, and certain enveloped viruses rely on antigenic variation to avoid the host immune defenses. These virulence factors are discussed in more detail in the following sections.</para>
<section id="fs-id1167583682704">
<title>Viral Adhesins</title>
<para id="fs-id1167584963290">One of the first steps in any viral infection is adhesion of the virus to specific receptors on the surface of cells. This process is mediated by adhesins that are part of the <term class="no-emphasis" id="term-00100">viral capsid</term> or <term class="no-emphasis" id="term-00101">membrane envelope</term>. The interaction of <term class="no-emphasis" id="term-00102">viral adhesins</term> with specific cell receptors defines the <term class="no-emphasis" id="term-00103">tropism</term> (preferential targeting) of viruses for specific cells, tissues, and organs in the body. The spike protein <term class="no-emphasis" id="term-00104">hemagglutinin</term> found on <term class="no-emphasis" id="term-00105">Influenzavirus</term> is an example of a viral adhesin; it allows the virus to bind to the <term class="no-emphasis" id="term-00106">sialic acid</term> on the membrane of host respiratory and intestinal cells. Another viral adhesin is the glycoprotein gp120, found on <term class="no-emphasis" id="term-00107">HIV</term>. For HIV to infect cells of the immune system, it must interact with two receptors on the surface of cells. The first interaction involves binding between gp120 and the CD4 cellular marker that is found on some essential immune system cells. However, before viral entry into the cell can occur, a second interaction between gp120 and one of two chemokine receptors (CCR5 and CXCR4) must occur. <link target-id="fs-id1167583717939"/> lists the adhesins for some common viral pathogens and the specific sites to which these adhesins allow viruses to attach.</para>

<title>Antigenic Variation in Viruses</title>
<para id="fs-id1167585009674">Antigenic variation also occurs in certain types of enveloped viruses, including influenza viruses, which exhibit two forms of antigenic variation: <term id="term-00108">antigenic drift</term> and <term id="term-00109">antigenic shift</term> (<link target-id="OSC_Microbio_15_03_Flu"/>). Antigenic drift is the result of point mutations causing slight changes in the spike proteins <term class="no-emphasis" id="term-00110">hemagglutinin</term> (H) and <term class="no-emphasis" id="term-00111">neuraminidase</term> (N). On the other hand, antigenic shift is a major change in spike proteins due to gene reassortment. This reassortment for antigenic shift occurs typically when two different influenza viruses infect the same host.</para>
<para id="fs-id1167583904934">The rate of antigenic variation in influenza viruses is very high, making it difficult for the immune system to recognize the many different strains of Influenzavirus. Although the body may develop immunity to one strain through natural exposure or vaccination, antigenic variation results in the continual emergence of new strains that the immune system will not recognize. This is the main reason that vaccines against Influenzavirus must be given annually. Each year’s <term class="no-emphasis" id="term-00112">influenza vaccine</term> provides protection against the most prevalent strains for that year, but new or different strains may be more prevalent the following year.</para>

<caption>Antigenic drift and antigenic shift in influenza viruses. (a) In antigenic drift, mutations in the genes for the surface proteins neuraminidase and/or hemagglutinin result in small antigenic changes over time. (b) In antigenic shift, simultaneous infection of a cell with two different influenza viruses results in mixing of the genes. The resultant virus possesses a mixture of the proteins of the original viruses. Influenza pandemics can often be traced to antigenic shifts.</caption>
