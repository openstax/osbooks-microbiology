<para id="fs-id1172099877853">Eukaryotic microbes are an extraordinarily diverse group, including species with a wide range of life cycles, morphological specializations, and nutritional needs. Although more diseases are caused by viruses and bacteria than by microscopic eukaryotes, these eukaryotes are responsible for some diseases of great public health importance. For example, the protozoal disease malaria was responsible for 584,000 deaths worldwide (primarily children in Africa) in 2013, according to the World Health Organization (WHO). The protist parasite <emphasis effect="italics">Giardia</emphasis> causes a diarrheal illness (giardiasis) that is easily transmitted through contaminated water supplies. In the United States, <emphasis effect="italics">Giardia</emphasis> is the most common human intestinal parasite (<link target-id="OSC_Microbio_05_01_giardia"/>). Although it may seem surprising, parasitic worms are included within the study of microbiology because identification depends on observation of microscopic adult worms or eggs. Even in developed countries, these worms are important parasites of humans and of domestic animals. There are fewer fungal pathogens, but these are important causes of illness, as well. On the other hand, fungi have been important in producing antimicrobial substances such as penicillin. In this chapter, we will examine characteristics of protists, worms, and fungi while considering their roles in causing disease.</para>

<title>Characteristics of Protists</title>
<para id="fs-id1172102150516">The word <emphasis effect="italics">protist</emphasis> is a historical term that is now used informally to refer to a diverse group of microscopic eukaryotic organisms. It is not considered a formal taxonomic term because the organisms it describes do not have a shared evolutionary origin. Historically, the <term class="no-emphasis" id="term-00003">protists</term> were informally grouped into the “animal-like” <term class="no-emphasis" id="term-00004">protozoans</term>, the “plant-like” <term class="no-emphasis" id="term-00005">algae</term>, and the “fungus-like” protists such as <term class="no-emphasis" id="term-00006">water molds</term>. These three groups of protists differ greatly in terms of their basic characteristics. For example, algae are photosynthetic organisms that can be unicellular or multicellular. Protozoa, on the other hand, are nonphotosynthetic, motile organisms that are always unicellular. Other informal terms may also be used to describe various groups of protists. For example, microorganisms that drift or float in water, moved by currents, are referred to as <term id="term-00007">plankton</term>. Types of plankton include <term id="term-00008">zooplankton</term>, which are motile and nonphotosynthetic, and <term id="term-00009">phytoplankton</term>, which are photosynthetic.</para>
<para id="fs-id1172099718040">Protozoans inhabit a wide variety of habitats, both aquatic and terrestrial. Many are free-living, while others are parasitic, carrying out a life cycle within a host or hosts and potentially causing illness. There are also beneficial symbionts that provide metabolic services to their hosts. During the feeding and growth part of their life cycle, they are called <term id="term-00010">trophozoite</term><emphasis effect="bold">s</emphasis>; these feed on small particulate food sources such as bacteria. While some types of protozoa exist exclusively in the trophozoite form, others can develop from trophozoite to an encapsulated cyst stage when environmental conditions are too harsh for the trophozoite. A <term id="term-00011">cyst</term> is a cell with a protective wall, and the process by which a trophozoite becomes a cyst is called <term id="term-00012">encystment</term>. When conditions become more favorable, these cysts are triggered by environmental cues to become active again through <term id="term-00013">excystment</term>.</para>
<para id="fs-id1172101802095">One protozoan genus capable of encystment is <term class="no-emphasis" id="term-00014"><emphasis effect="italics">Eimeria</emphasis></term>, which includes some human and animal pathogens. <link target-id="OSC_Microbio_05_01_Trophozoit"/> illustrates the life cycle of <emphasis effect="italics">Eimeria</emphasis>.</para>

A non-infectous unsporulated oocyst becomes an infectious sporulated oocyst. These enter the gut when swallowed and begin the proess of asexual schizogony. Oocsts realease sporocyts which release sporozoites. Sporozoites invate gut cells and form trophozoites. Trophozoites undergo schizogony (asexual reproduction) to form schizont which releases merozoites. Merozoites can reinfect and become trphozoites again or continue with sezual gametogon where the maerozoites form male and female gamets. The gamees undergo syngamy (sexual reproduction) to form a developing oocyst which mautres into an unsporulated non-infectious oocyst. This brings us back to the beginning of the environment sporogony stage of the cycle.">

<para id="fs-id1172102002036">Protozoans have a variety of reproductive mechanisms. Some protozoans reproduce asexually and others reproduce sexually; still others are capable of both sexual and asexual reproduction. In protozoans, asexual reproduction occurs by binary fission, budding, or schizogony. In <term id="term-00015">schizogony</term>, the nucleus of a cell divides multiple times before the cell divides into many smaller cells. The products of schizogony are called merozoites and they are stored in structures known as schizonts. Protozoans may also reproduce sexually, which increases genetic diversity and can lead to complex life cycles. Protozoans can produce haploid gametes that fuse through <term id="term-00016">syngamy</term>. However, they can also exchange genetic material by joining to exchange DNA in a process called <term class="no-emphasis" id="term-00017">conjugation</term>. This is a different process than the conjugation that occurs in bacteria. The term <term class="no-emphasis" id="term-00018">protist conjugation</term> refers to a true form of eukaryotic sexual reproduction between two cells of different mating types. It is found in <term id="term-00019">ciliate</term><emphasis effect="bold">s</emphasis>, a group of protozoans, and is described later in this subsection.</para>
<para id="fs-id1172101669261">All protozoans have a plasma membrane, or <term id="term-00020">plasmalemma</term>, and some have bands of protein just inside the membrane that add rigidity, forming a structure called the <term id="term-00021">pellicle</term>. Some protists, including protozoans, have distinct layers of cytoplasm under the membrane. In these protists, the outer gel layer (with microfilaments of actin) is called the <term id="term-00022">ectoplasm</term>. Inside this layer is a sol (fluid) region of cytoplasm called the <term id="term-00023">endoplasm</term>. These structures contribute to complex cell shapes in some protozoans, whereas others (such as amoebas) have more flexible shapes (<link target-id="OSC_Microbio_05_01_locom"/>).</para>

They may have a specialized structure for taking in food through phagocytosis, called a <term id="term-00024">cytostome</term>, and a specialized structure for the exocytosis of wastes called a <term id="term-00025">cytoproct</term>. Oral grooves leading to cytostomes are lined with hair-like cilia to sweep in food particles. Protozoans are heterotrophic. Protozoans that are <term id="term-00026">holozoic</term> ingest whole food particles through phagocytosis. Forms that are <term id="term-00027">saprozoic</term> ingest small, soluble food molecules.</para>

<para id="fs-id1172099902528">The supergroup <term class="no-emphasis" id="term-00055">Chromalveolata</term> is united by similar origins of its members’ plastids and includes the apicomplexans, ciliates, <term class="no-emphasis" id="term-00056">diatoms</term>, and <term class="no-emphasis" id="term-00057">dinoflagellates</term>, among other groups (we will cover the diatoms and dinoflagellates in <link document="m58805">Algae</link>).

The apical complex is a concentration of organelles, vacuoles, and microtubules that allows the parasite to enter host cells (<link target-id="OSC_Microbio_05_01_apical"/>). Apicomplexans have complex life cycles that include an infective sporozoite that undergoes <term class="no-emphasis" id="term-00060">schizogony</term> to make many merozoites (see the example in <link target-id="OSC_Microbio_05_01_Trophozoit"/>).

<para id="fs-id1172099721213">The ciliates (Ciliaphora), also within the Chromalveolata, are a large, very diverse group characterized by the presence of <term class="no-emphasis" id="term-00067">cilia</term> on their cell surface. Although the cilia may be used for locomotion, they are often used for feeding, as well, and some forms are nonmotile. <term class="no-emphasis" id="term-00068"><emphasis effect="italics">Balantidium coli</emphasis></term> (<link target-id="OSC_Microbio_05_01_balan"/>) is the only parasitic ciliate that affects humans by causing intestinal illness, although it rarely causes serious medical issues except in the immunocompromised (those having a weakened immune system). Perhaps the most familiar ciliate is <term class="no-emphasis" id="term-00069"><emphasis effect="italics">Paramecium</emphasis></term>, a motile organism with a clearly visible <term class="no-emphasis" id="term-00070">cytostome</term> and <term class="no-emphasis" id="term-00071">cytoproct</term> that is often studied in biology laboratories (<link target-id="OSC_Microbio_05_01_param"/>). Another ciliate, <term class="no-emphasis" id="term-00072"><emphasis effect="italics">Stentor</emphasis></term>, is sessile and uses its cilia for feeding (<link target-id="OSC_Microbio_05_01_stentor"/>). Generally, these organisms have a <term id="term-00073">micronucleus</term> that is diploid, somatic, and used for sexual reproduction by conjugation.

<para id="fs-id1172101775199">Ciliates are able to reproduce through <term class="no-emphasis" id="term-00075">conjugation</term>, in which two cells attach to each other. In each cell, the diploid micronuclei undergo meiosis, producing eight haploid nuclei each. Then, all but one of the haploid micronuclei and the macronucleus disintegrate; the remaining (haploid) micronucleus undergoes mitosis. The two cells then exchange one micronucleus each, which fuses with the remaining micronucleus present to form a new, genetically different, diploid micronucleus. The diploid micronucleus undergoes two mitotic divisions, so each cell has four micronuclei, and two of the four combine to form a new macronucleus. The chromosomes in the macronucleus then replicate repeatedly, the macronucleus reaches its polyploid state, and the two cells separate. The two cells are now genetically different from each other and from their previous versions.</para>

Parabasalia are frequent animal endosymbionts; they live in the guts of animals like termites and cockroaches. They have basal bodies and modified mitochondria (kinetoplastids). They also have a large, complex cell structure with an undulating membrane and often have many flagella. The trichomonads (a subgroup of the Parabasalia) include pathogens such as <term class="no-emphasis" id="term-00083"><emphasis effect="italics">Trichomonas vaginalis</emphasis></term>, which causes the human sexually transmitted disease <term class="no-emphasis" id="term-00084">trichomoniasis</term>.

<title>Neglected Parasites</title>
<para id="fs-id1172097144570">The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) is responsible for identifying public health priorities in the United States and developing strategies to address areas of concern. As part of this mandate, the CDC has officially identified five parasitic diseases it considers to have been neglected (i.e., not adequately studied). These <term class="no-emphasis" id="term-00094">neglected parasitic infections (NPIs)</term> include <term class="no-emphasis" id="term-00095">toxoplasmosis</term>, <term class="no-emphasis" id="term-00096">Chagas disease</term>, <term class="no-emphasis" id="term-00097">toxocariasis</term> (a nematode infection transmitted primarily by infected dogs), <term class="no-emphasis" id="term-00098">cysticercosis</term> (a disease caused by a tissue infection of the tapeworm <term class="no-emphasis" id="term-00099"><emphasis effect="italics">Taenia solium</emphasis></term>), and <term class="no-emphasis" id="term-00100">trichomoniasis</term> (a sexually transmitted disease caused by the parabasalid <term class="no-emphasis" id="term-00101"><emphasis effect="italics">Trichomonas vaginalis</emphasis></term>).</para>
<para id="fs-id1172102135224">The decision to name these specific diseases as NPIs means that the CDC will devote resources toward improving awareness and developing better diagnostic testing and treatment through studies of available data. The CDC may also advise on treatment of these diseases and assist in the distribution of medications that might otherwise be difficult to obtain.<footnote id="fs-id1172101911905">Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. “Neglected Parasitic Infections (NPIs) in the United States.” http://www.cdc.gov/parasites/npi/. Last updated July 10, 2014.</footnote></para>
<para id="fs-id1172102120468">Of course, the CDC does not have unlimited resources, so by prioritizing these five diseases, it is effectively deprioritizing others. Given that many Americans have never heard of many of these NPIs, it is fair to ask what criteria the CDC used in prioritizing diseases. According to the CDC, the factors considered were the number of people infected, the severity of the illness, and whether the illness can be treated or prevented. Although several of these NPIs may seem to be more common outside the United States, the CDC argues that many cases in the United States likely go undiagnosed and untreated because so little is known about these diseases.<footnote id="fs-id1172099384709">Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. “Fact Sheet: Neglected Parasitic Infections in the United States.” http://www.cdc.gov/parasites/resources/pdf/npi_factsheet.pdf</footnote></para>
