<para id="fs-id1167661292408">After a morning of playing outside, four-year-old Carli ran inside for lunch. After taking a bite of her fried egg, she pushed it away and whined, “It’s too slimy, Mommy. I don’t want any more.” But her mother, in no mood for games, curtly replied that if she wanted to go back outside she had better finish her lunch. Reluctantly, Carli complied, trying hard not to gag as she choked down the runny egg.</para>
<para id="fs-id1167663625689">That night, Carli woke up feeling nauseated. She cried for her parents and then began to vomit. Her parents tried to comfort her, but she continued to vomit all night and began to have diarrhea and run a fever. By the morning, her parents were very worried. They rushed her to the emergency room.</para>

<para id="fs-id1167661561742">The human <term class="no-emphasis" id="term-00001">digestive system</term>, or the gastrointestinal (GI) tract, begins with the mouth and ends with the anus. The parts of the mouth include the teeth, the gums, the tongue, the oral vestibule (the space between the gums, lips, and teeth), and the oral cavity proper (the space behind the teeth and gums). Other parts of the <term class="no-emphasis" id="term-00002">GI tract</term> are the pharynx, esophagus, stomach, small intestine, large intestine, rectum, and anus (<link target-id="OSC_Microbio_24_01_GITract"/>). Accessory digestive organs include the salivary glands, liver, gallbladder, spleen, and pancreas.</para>
<para id="fs-id1167661758547">The digestive system contains normal microbiota, including archaea, bacteria, fungi, protists, and even viruses. Because this microbiota is important for normal functioning of the digestive system, alterations to the microbiota by antibiotics or diet can be harmful. Additionally, the introduction of pathogens to the GI tract can cause infections and diseases. In this section, we will review the microbiota found in a healthy digestive tract and the general signs and symptoms associated with oral and GI infections.</para>

There are salivary glands in this region: the sublingual gland is under the tongue, the submandibular gland is below the jaw and the parotid gland is in the very back of the mouth. The mouth leads to the pharynx (a tube) that leads to the esophagus, that leads to the stomach, that leads to the small intestines. The small intestine is divided into 3 regions: first is the duodenum, next is the jejunim and finally the ileum. This leads to the large intestines which is divided into regions: first the cecum, then the ascending colon, then the transverse colon, then the descending colon, then the sigmoid colon, and finally the rectum, anal canal and anus.  The appendix is a small projection off the cecum. Also part of the digestive system is the large liver (above and to the right of the stomach), the gallbladder (a small sac under the liver), the pancrease (a structure below and behind the stomach) and the spleen (a structure below and to the left of the stomach).">

The crown is covered with <term class="no-emphasis" id="term-00010">enamel</term>, which is the hardest material in the body. Underneath the crown, a layer of relatively hard <term class="no-emphasis" id="term-00011">dentin</term> extends into the root of the tooth around the innermost <term class="no-emphasis" id="term-00012">pulp</term> cavity, which includes the pulp chamber at the top of the tooth and pulp canal, or <term class="no-emphasis" id="term-00013">root canal</term>, located in the root.

<para id="fs-id1167661293605">Microbes such as bacteria and archaea are abundant in the mouth and coat all of the surfaces of the oral cavity. However, different structures, such as the teeth or cheeks, host unique communities of both aerobic and anaerobic microbes. Some factors appear to work against making the mouth hospitable to certain microbes. For example, chewing allows microbes to mix better with saliva so they can be swallowed or spit out more easily. Saliva also contains enzymes, including <term class="no-emphasis" id="term-00019">lysozyme</term>, which can damage microbial cells. Recall that lysozyme is part of the first line of defense in the innate immune system and cleaves the β-(1,4) glycosidic linkages between N-acetylglucosamine (NAG) and N-acetylmuramic acid (NAM) in bacterial peptidoglycan (see <link document="m58878">Chemical Defenses</link>). Additionally, fluids containing immunoglobulins and phagocytic cells are produced in the gingival spaces. Despite all of these chemical and mechanical activities, the mouth supports a large microbial community.</para>

<title>Anatomy and Normal Microbiota of the GI Tract</title>
<para id="fs-id1167661277907">As food leaves the oral cavity, it travels through the pharynx, or the back of the throat, and moves into the <term class="no-emphasis" id="term-00020">esophagus</term>, which carries the food from the <term class="no-emphasis" id="term-00021">pharynx</term> to the <term class="no-emphasis" id="term-00022">stomach</term> without adding any additional digestive enzymes. The stomach produces <term class="no-emphasis" id="term-00023">mucus</term> to protect its lining, as well as digestive enzymes and acid to break down food. Partially digested food then leaves the stomach through the <term class="no-emphasis" id="term-00024">pyloric sphincter</term>, reaching the first part of the small intestine called the <term class="no-emphasis" id="term-00025">duodenum</term>. Pancreatic juice, which includes enzymes and bicarbonate ions, is released into the small intestine to neutralize the acidic material from the stomach and to assist in digestion. Bile, produced by the <term class="no-emphasis" id="term-00026">liver</term> but stored in the <term class="no-emphasis" id="term-00027">gallbladder</term>, is also released into the <term class="no-emphasis" id="term-00028">small intestine</term> to emulsify fats so that they can travel in the watery environment of the small intestine. Digestion continues in the small intestine, where the majority of nutrients contained in the food are absorbed. Simple columnar epithelial cells called <term class="no-emphasis" id="term-00029">enterocytes</term> line the lumen surface of the small intestinal folds called <term class="no-emphasis" id="term-00030">villi</term>.

<para id="fs-id1167663633507">Digested food leaves the small intestine and moves into the <term class="no-emphasis" id="term-00032">large intestine</term>, or <term class="no-emphasis" id="term-00033">colon</term>, where there is a more diverse microbiota. Near this junction, there is a small pouch in the large intestine called the <term class="no-emphasis" id="term-00034">cecum</term>, which attaches to the <term class="no-emphasis" id="term-00035">appendix</term>. Further digestion occurs throughout the colon and water is reabsorbed, then waste is excreted through the <term class="no-emphasis" id="term-00036">rectum</term>, the last section of the colon, and out of the body through the <term class="no-emphasis" id="term-00037">anus</term> (<link target-id="OSC_Microbio_24_01_GITract"/>).</para>
<para id="fs-id1167661367205">The environment of most of the GI tract is harsh, which serves two purposes: digestion and immunity. The stomach is an extremely acidic environment (pH 1.5–3.5) due to the gastric juices that break down food and kill many ingested microbes; this helps prevent infection from pathogens. The environment in the small intestine is less harsh and is able to support microbial communities. Microorganisms present in the small intestine can include <term class="no-emphasis" id="term-00038">lactobacilli</term>, <term class="no-emphasis" id="term-00039">diptherioids</term> and the fungus <term class="no-emphasis" id="term-00040"><emphasis effect="italics">Candida</emphasis></term>. On the other hand, the large intestine (colon) contains a diverse and abundant microbiota that is important for normal function. These microbes include <term class="no-emphasis" id="term-00041"><emphasis effect="italics">Bacteriodetes</emphasis></term> (especially the genera <term class="no-emphasis" id="term-00042"><emphasis effect="italics">Bacteroides</emphasis></term> and <term class="no-emphasis" id="term-00043"><emphasis effect="italics">Prevotella</emphasis></term>) and <term class="no-emphasis" id="term-00044"><emphasis effect="italics">Firmicutes</emphasis></term> (especially members of the genus <term class="no-emphasis" id="term-00045"><emphasis effect="italics">Clostridium</emphasis></term>). Methanogenic archaea and some fungi are also present, among many other species of bacteria. These microbes all aid in digestion and contribute to the production of feces, the waste excreted from the digestive tract, and flatus, the gas produced from microbial fermentation of undigested food. They can also produce valuable nutrients. For example, <term class="no-emphasis" id="term-00046">lactic acid bacteria</term> such as <term class="no-emphasis" id="term-00047">bifidobacteria</term> can synthesize vitamins, such as vitamin B12, folate, and riboflavin, that humans cannot synthesize themselves. <emphasis effect="italics">E. coli</emphasis> found in the intestine can also break down food and help the body produce vitamin K, which is important for blood coagulation.</para>
<para id="fs-id1167663966984">The GI tract has several other methods of reducing the risk of infection by pathogens. Small aggregates of underlying lymphoid tissue in the ileum, called <term id="term-00048">Peyer’s patches</term> (<link target-id="OSC_Microbio_24_01_Villi"/>), detect pathogens in the intestines via microfold (M) cells, which transfer antigens from the lumen of the intestine to the lymphocytes on Peyer’s patches to induce an immune response. The Peyer’s patches then secrete <term class="no-emphasis" id="term-00049">IgA</term> and other pathogen-specific antibodies into the intestinal lumen to help keep intestinal microbes at safe levels. Goblet cells, which are modified simple columnar epithelial cells, also line the <term class="no-emphasis" id="term-00050">GI tract</term> (<link target-id="OSC_Microbio_24_01_GobletCell"/>). Goblet cells secrete a gel-forming <term class="no-emphasis" id="term-00051">mucin</term>, which is the major component of <term class="no-emphasis" id="term-00052">mucus</term>. The production of a protective layer of mucus helps reduce the risk of pathogens reaching deeper tissues.</para>
<para id="fs-id1167661731022">The constant movement of materials through the gastrointestinal tract also helps to move transient pathogens out of the body. In fact, feces are composed of approximately 25% microbes, 25% sloughed epithelial cells, 25% mucus, and 25% digested or undigested food. Finally, the normal microbiota provides an additional barrier to infection via a variety of mechanisms. For example, these organisms outcompete potential pathogens for space and nutrients within the intestine. This is known as <term class="no-emphasis" id="term-00053">competitive exclusion</term>. Members of the microbiota may also secrete protein toxins known as <term class="no-emphasis" id="term-00054">bacteriocins</term> that are able to bind to specific receptors on the surface of susceptible bacteria.</para>

<title>General Signs and Symptoms of Oral and GI Disease</title>
<para id="fs-id1167663731062">Despite numerous defense mechanisms that protect against infection, all parts of the digestive tract can become sites of infection or intoxication. The term <term class="no-emphasis" id="term-00055">food poisoning</term> is sometimes used as a catch-all for GI infections and intoxications, but not all forms of GI disease originate with foodborne pathogens or toxins.</para>
<para id="fs-id1167661307660">In the mouth, <term class="no-emphasis" id="term-00056">fermentation</term> by anaerobic microbes produces acids that damage the teeth and gums. This can lead to tooth decay, cavities, and <term id="term-00057">periodontal disease</term>, a condition characterized by chronic inflammation and erosion of the <term class="no-emphasis" id="term-00058">gums</term>. Additionally, some pathogens can cause infections of the mucosa, glands, and other structures in the mouth, resulting in inflammation, sores, cankers, and other lesions. An open sore in the mouth or GI tract is typically called an <term id="term-00059">ulcer</term>.</para>
<para id="fs-id1167664000060">Infections and intoxications of the lower GI tract often produce symptoms such as nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, aches, and fever. In some cases, vomiting and diarrhea may cause severe dehydration and other complications that can become serious or fatal. Various clinical terms are used to describe gastrointestinal symptoms. For example, <term id="term-00060">gastritis</term> is an inflammation of the stomach lining that results in swelling and <term id="term-00061">enteritis</term> refers to inflammation of the intestinal mucosa. When the inflammation involves both the stomach lining and the intestinal lining, the condition is called <term id="term-00062">gastroenteritis</term>. Inflammation of the liver is called <term id="term-00063">hepatitis</term>. Inflammation of the colon, called <term id="term-00064">colitis</term>, commonly occurs in cases of food intoxication. Because an inflamed colon does not reabsorb water as effectively as it normally does, stools become watery, causing diarrhea. Damage to the epithelial cells of the colon can also cause bleeding and excess <term class="no-emphasis" id="term-00065">mucus</term> to appear in watery stools, a condition called <term id="term-00066">dysentery</term>.</para>
