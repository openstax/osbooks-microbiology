<para id="fs-id1172096214466">Fungi are important to humans in a variety of ways. Both microscopic and macroscopic fungi have medical relevance, with some pathogenic species that can cause <term id="term-00002">mycoses</term> (illnesses caused by fungi). Some pathogenic fungi are opportunistic, meaning that they mainly cause infections when the host’s immune defenses are compromised and do not normally cause illness in healthy individuals. Fungi are important in other ways. They act as decomposers in the environment, and they are critical for the production of certain foods such as cheeses. Fungi are also major sources of antibiotics, such as <term class="no-emphasis" id="term-00003">penicillin</term> from the fungus <term class="no-emphasis" id="term-00004"><emphasis effect="italics">Penicillium</emphasis></term>.</para>

<title>Characteristics of Fungi</title>
<para id="fs-id1172100726720">Fungi have well-defined characteristics that set them apart from other organisms. Most multicellular fungal bodies, commonly called <term class="no-emphasis" id="term-00005">molds</term>, are made up of filaments called <term id="term-00006">hyphae</term>. Hyphae can form a tangled network called a <term id="term-00007">mycelium</term> and form the <term id="term-00008">thallus</term> (body) of fleshy fungi. Hyphae that have walls between the cells are called <term id="term-00009">septate hyphae</term>; hyphae that lack walls and cell membranes between the cells are called nonseptate or <term id="term-00010">coenocytic hyphae</term>).

These <term id="term-00014">dimorphic fungi</term> may be able to appear as yeasts or molds, which can be important for infectivity. They are capable of changing their appearance in response to environmental changes such as nutrient availability or fluctuations in temperature, growing as a mold, for example, at 25 °C (77 °F), and as yeast cells at 37 °C (98.6 °F). This ability helps dimorphic fungi to survive in diverse environments. Two examples of dimorphic yeasts are the human pathogens Histoplasma capsulatum and Candida albicans. H. capsulatum causes the lung disease histoplasmosis, and C. albicans is associated with vaginal yeast infections, oral thrush, and candidiasis of the skin (<link target-id="OSC_Microbio_05_03_struct"/>).</para><figure id="OSC_Microbio_05_03_struct">

<para id="fs-id1172098378521">There are notable unique features in fungal cell walls and membranes. Fungal cell walls contain <term id="term-00015">chitin</term>, as opposed to the cellulose found in the cell walls of plants and many protists. Additionally, whereas animals have cholesterol in their cell membranes, fungal cell membranes have different sterols called <term class="no-emphasis" id="term-00016">ergosterols</term>. Ergosterols are often exploited as targets for antifungal drugs.</para>
<para id="fs-id1172100597033">Fungal life cycles are unique and complex. Fungi reproduce sexually either through cross- or self-fertilization. Haploid fungi form hyphae that have gametes at the tips. Two different mating types (represented as “+ type” and “– type”) are involved. The cytoplasms of the + and – type gametes fuse (in an event called plasmogamy), producing a cell with two distinct nuclei (a <term id="term-00017">dikaryotic</term> cell). Later, the nuclei fuse (in an event called <term class="no-emphasis" id="term-00018">karyogamy</term>) to create a diploid zygote. The zygote undergoes meiosis to form <term id="term-00019">spores</term> that germinate to start the haploid stage, which eventually creates more haploid mycelia (<link target-id="OSC_Microbio_05_03_zygo"/>). Depending on the taxonomic group, these sexually produced spores are known as zygospores (in Zygomycota), ascospores (in Ascomycota), or basidiospores (in Basidiomycota) (<link target-id="OSC_Microbio_05_03_spores"/>).</para>
<para id="fs-id1172100565958">Fungi may also exhibit asexual reproduction by mitosis, mitosis with budding, fragmentation of hyphae, and formation of asexual spores by mitosis. These spores are specialized cells that, depending on the organism, may have unique characteristics for survival, reproduction, and dispersal. Fungi exhibit several types of asexual spores and these can be important in classification.</para>

<media id="fs-id1172100857209" alt="Zygomycete life cycle. The mycelia can undergo asexual reproduction by forming spores via mitosis. The spores then form mycelia by germination. The haploid spores can also undergo sexual reproduction. The first step is germination when mycelia form. If the two mating types (+ and -) are in close proximity, extensions called gametangia form between them. Next is plasmogamy. This is the fusion between the + and – mating types resulting in a zygosporangium with multiple haploid nucei. The zygosporangiom forms a thick, protective coat. Next the nuclei fuse to form a zygote with multiple diploid nuclei in karyogamy. This forms a diploid zygote. Next is mitosis and germination where the sporangium grows on a short stalk and the haploid spores are formed inside. The spores are released in germination and we are back to the spore stage of the life cycle.">

<title>Fungal Diversity</title>
<para id="fs-id1172098401277">The <term class="no-emphasis" id="term-00020">fungi</term> are very diverse, comprising seven major groups. Not all of the seven groups contain pathogens. Some of these groups are generally associated with plants and include plant pathogens. For example, Urediniomycetes and Ustilagomycetes include the plant <term class="no-emphasis" id="term-00021">rusts</term> and <term class="no-emphasis" id="term-00022">smuts</term>, respectively. These form reddish or dark masses, respectively, on plants as rusts (red) or smuts (dark). Some species have substantial economic impact because of their ability to reduce crop yields. Glomeromycota includes the <term class="no-emphasis" id="term-00023">mycorrhizal fungi</term>, important symbionts with plant roots that can promote plant growth by acting like an extended root system. The Glomeromycota are obligate symbionts, meaning that they can only survive when associated with plant roots; the fungi receive carbohydrates from the plant and the plant benefits from the increased ability to take up nutrients and minerals from the soil. The Chytridiomycetes (<term class="no-emphasis" id="term-00024">chytrids</term>) are small fungi, but are extremely ecologically important. Chytrids are generally aquatic and have flagellated, motile gametes; specific types are implicated in amphibian declines around the world. Because of their medical importance, we will focus on Zygomycota, Ascomycota, Basidiomycota, and Microsporidia. <link target-id="OSC_Microbio_05_03_TaxaTable"/> summarizes the characteristics of these medically important groups of fungi.</para>
<para id="fs-id1172101005731">The <term class="no-emphasis" id="term-00025">Zygomycota</term> (zygomycetes) are mainly saprophytes with coenocytic hyphae and haploid nuclei. They use sporangiospores for asexual reproduction. The group name comes from the <term id="term-00026">zygospores</term> that they use for sexual reproduction (<link target-id="OSC_Microbio_05_03_zygo"/>), which have hard walls formed from the fusion of reproductive cells from two individuals. Zygomycetes are important for food science and as crop pathogens. One example is <term class="no-emphasis" id="term-00027"><emphasis effect="italics">Rhizopus stolonifer</emphasis></term> (<link target-id="OSC_Microbio_05_03_spores"/>), an important bread mold that also causes rice seedling blight. <term class="no-emphasis" id="term-00028"><emphasis effect="italics">Mucor</emphasis></term> is a genus of fungi that can potentially cause necrotizing infections in humans, although most species are intolerant of temperatures found in mammalian bodies (<link target-id="OSC_Microbio_05_03_spores"/>).</para>
<para id="fs-id1172100858264">The <term class="no-emphasis" id="term-00029">Ascomycota</term> include fungi that are used as food (edible mushrooms, morels, and truffles), others that are common causes of food spoilage (bread molds and plant pathogens), and still others that are human pathogens. Ascomycota may have septate hyphae and cup-shaped fruiting bodies called <term id="term-00030">ascocarps</term>. Some genera of Ascomycota use sexually produced <term id="term-00031">ascospores</term> as well as asexual spores called <term id="term-00032">conidia</term>, but sexual phases have not been discovered or described for others. Some produce an <term id="term-00033">ascus</term> containing ascospores within an ascocarp (<link target-id="OSC_Microbio_05_03_asclife"/>).</para>

<item>The fungi include diverse saprotrophic eukaryotic organisms with chitin cell walls</item>
<item>Fungi can be unicellular or multicellular; some (like yeast) and fungal spores are microscopic, whereas some are large and conspicuous</item>
<item>Reproductive types are important in distinguishing fungal groups</item>
<item>Medically important species exist in the four fungal groups Zygomycota, Ascomycota, Basidiomycota, and Microsporidia</item>
<item>Members of Zygomycota, Ascomycota, and Basidiomycota produce deadly toxins</item>
<item>Important differences in fungal cells, such as ergosterols in fungal membranes, can be targets for antifungal medications, but similarities between human and fungal cells make it difficult to find targets for medications and these medications often have toxic adverse effects</item>
