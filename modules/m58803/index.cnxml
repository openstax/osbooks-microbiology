<para id="fs-id1172102147344">Parasitic helminths are animals that are often included within the study of microbiology because many species of these worms are identified by their microscopic eggs and larvae. There are two major groups of <term class="no-emphasis" id="term-00001">parasitic helminths</term>: the roundworms (Nematoda) and flatworms (Platyhelminthes). Of the many species that exist in these groups, about half are parasitic and some are important human pathogens. As animals, they are multicellular and have organ systems. However, the parasitic species often have limited digestive tracts, nervous systems, and locomotor abilities. Parasitic forms may have complex reproductive cycles with several different life stages and more than one type of host. Some are <term id="term-00002">monoecious</term>, having both male and female reproductive organs in a single individual, while others are <term id="term-00003">dioecious</term>, each having either male or female reproductive organs.</para>

The Cercariae released by snail into the water are free flowing and are the infective stage which can penetrate skin. S. mansoni travels to the large intestines, S. japonicum travels to the small intestines, and S. haemotobium travels to the rectum. The cercariae lose their tails during penetration and become schistosomalae. Theese enter circulation and migrate to portal blood in liver and mature into adults.

More than 200 million people have schistosomiasis worldwide. Most of the World Health Organization (WHO) neglected tropical diseases are helminths. In some cases, helminths may cause subclinical illnesses, meaning the symptoms are so mild that that they go unnoticed.

Additionally, no vaccines or medication are required for treatment and prevention. In 1986, 3.5 million people were estimated to be affected.
