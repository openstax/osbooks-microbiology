<para id="fs-id1172100578005">Ask most people “What are the major requirements for life?” and the answers are likely to include water and oxygen. Few would argue about the need for water, but what about oxygen? Can there be life without oxygen?</para>
<para id="fs-id1172101033602">The answer is that molecular oxygen (O<sub>2</sub>) is not always needed. The earliest signs of life are dated to a period when conditions on earth were highly reducing and free oxygen gas was essentially nonexistent. Only after cyanobacteria started releasing oxygen as a byproduct of photosynthesis and the capacity of iron in the oceans for taking up oxygen was exhausted did oxygen levels increase in the atmosphere. This event, often referred to as the <term class="no-emphasis" id="term-00001">Great Oxygenation Event</term> or the <term class="no-emphasis" id="term-00002">Oxygen Revolution</term>, caused a massive extinction. Most organisms could not survive the powerful oxidative properties of <term id="term-00003">reactive oxygen species</term> (ROS), highly unstable ions and molecules derived from partial reduction of oxygen that can damage virtually any macromolecule or structure with which they come in contact. Singlet oxygen (O<sub>2</sub>•), superoxide <m:math><m:mrow><m:mrow><m:mo>(</m:mo><m:mrow><m:msup><m:mrow><m:msub><m:mtext>O</m:mtext><m:mn>2</m:mn></m:msub></m:mrow><m:mtext>−</m:mtext></m:msup></m:mrow><m:mo>)</m:mo></m:mrow><m:mo>,</m:mo></m:mrow></m:math> peroxides (H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub>), hydroxyl radical (OH•), and hypochlorite ion (OCl<sup>−</sup>), the active ingredient of household bleach, are all examples of ROS. The organisms that were able to detoxify reactive oxygen species harnessed the high electronegativity of oxygen to produce free energy for their metabolism and thrived in the new environment.</para>

<title>Oxygen Requirements of Microorganisms</title>
<para id="fs-id1172100737958">Many ecosystems are still free of molecular oxygen. Some are found in extreme locations, such as deep in the ocean or in earth’s crust; others are part of our everyday landscape, such as marshes, bogs, and sewers. Within the bodies of humans and other animals, regions with little or no oxygen provide an anaerobic environment for microorganisms. (<link target-id="OSC_Microbio_09_02_bog"/>).</para>

<para id="fs-id1172098674053">We can easily observe different requirements for molecular oxygen by growing bacteria in <term id="term-00004">thioglycolate tube culture</term>s. A test-tube culture starts with autoclaved <term id="term-00005">thioglycolate medium</term> containing a low percentage of agar to allow motile bacteria to move throughout the medium. Thioglycolate has strong reducing properties and autoclaving flushes out most of the oxygen. The tubes are inoculated with the bacterial cultures to be tested and incubated at an appropriate temperature. Over time, oxygen slowly diffuses throughout the thioglycolate tube culture from the top. Bacterial density increases in the area where oxygen concentration is best suited for the growth of that particular organism.</para>
<para id="fs-id1172098316514">The growth of bacteria with varying oxygen requirements in thioglycolate tubes is illustrated in <link target-id="OSC_Microbio_09_02_tubO"/>. In tube A, all the growth is seen at the top of the tube. The bacteria are <term id="term-00006">obligate (strict) aerobe</term>s that cannot grow without an abundant supply of oxygen. Tube B looks like the opposite of tube A. Bacteria grow at the bottom of tube B. Those are <term id="term-00007">obligate anaerobe</term>s, which are killed by oxygen. Tube C shows heavy growth at the top of the tube and growth throughout the tube, a typical result with <term id="term-00008">facultative anaerobe</term>s. Facultative anaerobes are organisms that thrive in the presence of oxygen but also grow in its absence by relying on fermentation or anaerobic respiration, if there is a suitable electron acceptor other than oxygen and the organism is able to perform anaerobic respiration. The <term id="term-00009">aerotolerant anaerobe</term>s in tube D are indifferent to the presence of oxygen. They do not use oxygen because they usually have a fermentative metabolism, but they are not harmed by the presence of oxygen as obligate anaerobes are. Tube E on the right shows a “Goldilocks” culture. The oxygen level has to be just right for growth, not too much and not too little. These <term id="term-00010">microaerophile</term>s are bacteria that require a minimum level of oxygen for growth, about 1%–10%, well below the 21% found in the atmosphere.</para>

<para id="fs-id1172098394815">Many obligate anaerobes are found in the environment where anaerobic conditions exist, such as in deep sediments of soil, still waters, and at the bottom of the deep ocean where there is no photosynthetic life. Anaerobic conditions also exist naturally in the intestinal tract of animals. Obligate anaerobes, mainly <term class="no-emphasis" id="term-00016"><emphasis effect="italics">Bacteroidetes</emphasis></term>, represent a large fraction of the microbes in the human gut. Transient anaerobic conditions exist when tissues are not supplied with blood circulation; they die and become an ideal breeding ground for obligate anaerobes. Another type of obligate anaerobe encountered in the human body is the gram-positive, rod-shaped <term class="no-emphasis" id="term-00017"><emphasis effect="italics">Clostridioides</emphasis></term> and <emphasis effect="italics"><term class="no-emphasis" id="term-00038">Clostridium</term></emphasis> spp. Their ability to form endospores allows them to survive in the presence of oxygen. One of the major causes of health-acquired infections is <emphasis effect="italics">C. difficile</emphasis>, known as C. diff. Prolonged use of antibiotics for other infections increases the probability of a patient developing a secondary <emphasis effect="italics">C. difficile</emphasis> infection. Antibiotic treatment disrupts the balance of microorganisms in the intestine and allows the colonization of the gut by <emphasis effect="italics">Clostridioides difficile</emphasis>, causing a significant inflammation of the colon.</para>
<para id="fs-id1172101005919">Other clostridia responsible for serious infections include <emphasis effect="italics">C. tetani</emphasis>, the agent of tetanus, and <emphasis effect="italics">C. perfringens</emphasis>, which causes <term class="no-emphasis" id="term-00018">gas gangrene</term>. In both cases, the infection starts in necrotic tissue (dead tissue that is not supplied with oxygen by blood circulation). This is the reason that deep puncture wounds are associated with tetanus. When tissue death is accompanied by lack of circulation, gangrene is always a danger.</para>
<para id="fs-id1172096331915">The study of obligate anaerobes requires special equipment. Obligate anaerobic bacteria must be grown under conditions devoid of oxygen. The most common approach is culture in an <term id="term-00019">anaerobic jar</term> (<link target-id="OSC_Microbio_09_02_jar"/>). Anaerobic jars include chemical packs that remove oxygen and release carbon dioxide (CO<sub>2</sub>). An <term id="term-00020">anaerobic chamber</term> is an enclosed box from which all oxygen is removed. Gloves sealed to openings in the box allow handling of the cultures without exposing the culture to air (<link target-id="OSC_Microbio_09_02_jar"/>).</para>

<para id="fs-id1172098710249">Staphylococci and <term class="no-emphasis" id="term-00021">Enterobacteriaceae</term> are examples of facultative anaerobes. Staphylococci are found on the skin and upper respiratory tract. Enterobacteriaceae are found primarily in the gut and upper respiratory tract but can sometimes spread to the urinary tract, where they are capable of causing infections. It is not unusual to see mixed bacterial infections in which the facultative anaerobes use up the oxygen, creating an environment for the obligate anaerobes to flourish.</para>

Although he has felt tingling and numbness in his left foot for a while, he has not been worried because he thought his foot was simply “falling asleep.” Recently, a scratch on his foot does not seem to be healing and is becoming increasingly ugly. Because the sore did not bother him much, Charles figured it could not be serious until his daughter noticed a purplish discoloration spreading on the skin and oozing (<link target-id="OSC_Microbio_09_02_foot"/>).

<title>Detoxification of Reactive Oxygen Species</title>
<para id="fs-id1172100560107">Aerobic respiration constantly generates reactive oxygen species (ROS), byproducts that must be detoxified. Even organisms that do not use aerobic respiration need some way to break down some of the ROS that may form from atmospheric oxygen.

The goal is to demonstrate staining of a mixed culture. The flask is incubated at 35 °C for 24 hours without aeration. A sample is stained and reveals only gram-negative rods. Both cultures are known facultative anaerobes. Give a likely reason for success of the gram-negative rod. Assume that the cultures have comparable intrinsic growth rates.</para>
