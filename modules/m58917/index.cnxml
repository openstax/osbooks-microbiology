<para id="fs-id1167660274729">Nadia is a newly married 26-year-old graduate student in economics. Recently she has been experiencing an unusual vaginal discharge, as well as some itching and discomfort. Since she is due for her annual physical exam, she makes an appointment with her doctor hoping that her symptoms can be quickly treated. However, she worries that she may have some sort of sexually transmitted infection (STI). Although she is now in a monogamous relationship, she is not fully certain of her spouse’s sexual history and she is reluctant to ask him about it.</para>
<para id="fs-id1167660275844">At her checkup, Nadia describes her symptoms to her primary care physician and, somewhat awkwardly, explains why she thinks she might have an STI. Nadia’s doctor reassures her that she regularly sees patients with similar concerns and encourages her to be fully transparent about her symptoms because some STIs can have serious complications if left untreated. After some further questioning, the doctor takes samples of Nadia’s blood, urine, and vaginal discharge to be sent to the lab for testing.</para>

Fluids, electrolytes, and molecules from the blood pass from the glomerulus into the nephron, creating the filtrate that becomes urine (<link target-id="OSC_Microbio_23_01_Nephron"/>). Urine that collects in each kidney empties through a <term id="term-00006">ureter</term> and drains to the <term id="term-00007">urinary bladder</term>, which stores urine.

<title>Normal Microbiota of the Urogenital System</title>
<para id="fs-id1167660151109">The normal <term class="no-emphasis" id="term-00021">microbiota</term> of different body sites provides an important nonspecific defense against infectious diseases (see <link document="m58877">Physical Defenses</link>), and the urogenital tract is no exception. However, the kidneys are sterile. Although urine does contain some antibacterial components, bacteria will grow in urine left out at room temperature. Therefore, it is primarily the flushing action that keeps the ureters and bladder free of microbes.</para>
<para id="fs-id1167660227916">Below the bladder, the normal microbiota of the male urogenital system is found primarily within the distal urethra and includes bacterial species that are commonly associated with the skin microbiota. In females, the normal microbiota is found within the distal one third of the urethra and the vagina. The normal microbiota of the vagina becomes established shortly after birth and is a complex and dynamic population of bacteria that fluctuates in response to environmental changes. Members of the vaginal microbiota play an important role in the nonspecific defense against vaginal infections and sexually transmitted infections by occupying cellular binding sites and competing for nutrients. In addition, the production of <term class="no-emphasis" id="term-00022">lactic acid</term> by members of the microbiota provides an acidic environment within the vagina that also serves as a defense against infections. For the majority of females, the lactic-acid–producing bacteria in the vagina are dominated by a variety of species of <term class="no-emphasis" id="term-00023"><emphasis effect="italics">Lactobacillus</emphasis></term>. For females who lack sufficient lactobacilli in their vagina, lactic acid production comes primarily from other species of bacteria such as <term class="no-emphasis" id="term-00024"><emphasis effect="italics">Leptotrichia</emphasis></term> spp., <term class="no-emphasis" id="term-00025"><emphasis effect="italics">Megasphaera</emphasis></term> spp., and <term class="no-emphasis" id="term-00026"><emphasis effect="italics">Atopobium vaginae</emphasis></term>. <emphasis effect="italics">Lactobacillus</emphasis> spp. use <term class="no-emphasis" id="term-00027">glycogen</term> from vaginal epithelial cells for metabolism and production of lactic acid. This process is tightly regulated by the hormone estrogen. Increased levels of estrogen correlate with increased levels of vaginal glycogen, increased production of lactic acid, and a lower <term class="no-emphasis" id="term-00028">vaginal pH</term>. Therefore, decreases in estrogen during the menstrual cycle and with menopause are associated with decreased levels of vaginal glycogen and lactic acid, and a higher pH. In addition to producing lactic acid, <emphasis effect="italics">Lactobacillus</emphasis> spp. also contribute to the defenses against infectious disease through their production of hydrogen peroxide and <term class="no-emphasis" id="term-00029">bacteriocins</term> (antibacterial peptides).</para>

<title>General Signs and Symptoms of Urogenital Infections</title>
<para id="fs-id1167662714999">Infections of the urinary tract most commonly cause inflammation of the bladder (<term id="term-00030">cystitis</term>) or of the urethra (<term id="term-00031">urethritis</term>). Urethritis can be associated with cystitis, but can also be caused by sexually transmitted infections. Symptoms of urethritis in males include burning sensation while urinating, discharge from the penis, and blood in the semen or the urine. In females, urethritis is associated with painful and frequent urination, vaginal discharge, fever, chills, and abdominal pain. The symptoms of cystitis are similar to those of urethritis. When urethritis is caused by a sexually transmitted pathogen, additional symptoms involving the genitalia can occur. These can include painful vesicles (blisters), warts, and ulcers. Ureteritis, a rare infection of the ureter, can also occur with cystitis. These infections can be acute or chronic.</para>
<para id="fs-id1167662607886"><term id="term-00032">Pyelonephritis</term> and <term id="term-00033">glomerulonephritis</term> are infections of the kidney that are potentially serious. Pyelonephritis is an infection of one or both of the kidneys and may develop from a lower urinary tract infection; the upper urinary tract, including the ureters, is often affected. Signs and symptoms of pyelonephritis include fever, chills, nausea, vomiting, lower back pain, and frequent painful urination. Pyelonephritis usually only becomes chronic in individuals who have malformations in or damage to the kidneys.</para>
<para id="fs-id1167660217077">Glomerulonephritis is an inflammation of the glomeruli of the nephrons. Symptoms include excessive protein and blood in urine, increased blood pressure, and fluid retention leading to edema of face, hands, and feet. Glomerulonephritis may be an acute infection or it can become chronic.</para>
<para id="fs-id1167662555167">Infections occurring within the reproductive structures of males include epididymitis, orchitis, and prostatitis. Bacterial infections may cause inflammation of the epididymis, called <term id="term-00034">epididymitis</term>. This inflammation causes pain in the scrotum, testicles, and groin; swelling, redness, and warm skin in these areas may also be observed. Inflammation of the testicle, called <term id="term-00035">orchitis</term>, is usually caused by a bacterial infection spreading from the epididymis, but it can also be a complication of mumps, a viral disease. The symptoms are similar to those of epididymitis, and it is not uncommon for them both to occur together, in which case the condition is called epididymo-orchitis. Inflammation of the prostate gland, called <term id="term-00036">prostatitis</term>, can result from a bacterial infection. The signs and symptoms of prostatitis include fever, chills, and pain in the bladder, testicles, and penis. Patients may also experience burning during urination, difficulty emptying the bladder, and painful ejaculation.</para>
<para id="fs-id1167662446643">Because of its proximity to the exterior, the vagina is a common site for infections. The general term for any inflammation of the vagina is <term id="term-00037">vaginitis</term>. Vaginitis often develops as a result of an overgrowth of bacteria or fungi that normally reside in the vaginal microbiota, although it can also result from infections by transient pathogens. Bacterial infections of the vagina are called bacterial <term id="term-00038">vaginosis</term>, whereas fungal infections (typically involving <emphasis effect="italics">Candida</emphasis> spp.) are called <term id="term-00039">yeast infection</term><emphasis effect="bold">s</emphasis>. Dynamic changes affecting the normal microbiota, acid production, and pH variations can be involved in the initiation of the microbial overgrowth and the development of vaginitis. Although some individuals may have no symptoms, vaginosis and vaginitis can be associated with discharge, odor, itching, and burning.</para>
<para id="fs-id1167662554385"><term id="term-00040">Pelvic inflammatory disease (PID)</term> is an infection of the female reproductive organs including the uterus, cervix, fallopian tubes, and ovaries. The two most common pathogens are the sexually transmitted bacterial pathogens <term class="no-emphasis" id="term-00041"><emphasis effect="italics">Neisseria gonorrhoeae</emphasis></term> and <term class="no-emphasis" id="term-00042"><emphasis effect="italics">Chlamydia trachomatis</emphasis></term>. Inflammation of the fallopian tubes, called <term id="term-00043">salpingitis</term>, is the most serious form of PID. Symptoms of PID can vary between people and include pain in the lower abdomen, vaginal discharge, fever, chills, nausea, diarrhea, vomiting, and painful urination.</para>

<title>General Causes and Modes of Transmission of Urogenital Infections</title>
<para id="fs-id1167660289622">Hormonal changes, particularly shifts in <term class="no-emphasis" id="term-00044">estrogen</term> due to <term class="no-emphasis" id="term-00045">pregnancy</term> or <term class="no-emphasis" id="term-00046">menopause</term>, can increase susceptibility to urogenital infections. As discussed earlier, estrogen plays an important role in regulating the availability of glycogen and subsequent production of lactic acid by <emphasis effect="italics">Lactobacillus</emphasis> species. Low levels of estrogen are associated with an increased vaginal pH and an increased risk of bacterial vaginosis and <term class="no-emphasis" id="term-00047">yeast infection</term>s. Estrogen also plays a role in maintaining the elasticity, strength, and thickness of the vaginal wall, and keeps the vaginal wall lubricated, reducing dryness. Low levels of estrogen are associated with thinning of the vaginal wall. This thinning increases the risk of tears and abrasions, which compromise the protective barrier and increase susceptibility to pathogens.</para>
<para id="fs-id1167662551064">Another common cause of urogenital infections in females is fecal contamination that occurs because of the close proximity of the anus and the urethra. <term class="no-emphasis" id="term-00048"><emphasis effect="italics">Escherichia coli</emphasis></term>, an important member of the digestive tract microbiota, is the most common cause of <term class="no-emphasis" id="term-00049">urinary tract infections</term> (urethritis and cystitis) in females; it generally causes infection when it is introduced to the urethra in fecal matter. Good hygiene can reduce the risk of urinary tract infections by this route. In males, urinary tract infections are more commonly associated with other conditions, such as an enlarged prostate, kidney stones, or placement of a urinary catheter. All of these conditions impair the normal emptying of the bladder, which serves to flush out microbes capable of causing infection.</para>
<para id="fs-id1167662418068">Infections that are transmitted between individuals through sexual contact are called <term class="no-emphasis" id="term-00050">sexually transmitted infections</term> (STIs) or <term class="no-emphasis" id="term-00051">sexually transmitted diseases</term> (STDs). (The CDC prefers the term STD, but WHO prefers STI,<footnote id="fs-id1167662461367">World Health Organization. “Guidelines for the Management of Sexually Transmitted Infections.” World Health Organization, 2003. http://www.who.int/hiv/pub/sti/en/STIGuidelines2003.pdf.</footnote> which encompasses infections that result in disease as well as those that are subclinical or asymptomatic.) STIs often affect the external genitalia and skin, where microbes are easily transferred through physical contact. Lymph nodes in the genital region may also become swollen as a result of infection. However, many STIs have systemic effects as well, causing symptoms that range from mild (e.g., general malaise) to severe (e.g., liver damage or serious immunosuppression).</para>
