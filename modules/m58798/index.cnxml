<para id="fs-id1172100854166">Prokaryotes are identified as gram-positive if they have a multiple layer matrix of peptidoglycan forming the cell wall. Crystal violet, the primary stain of the Gram stain procedure, is readily retained and stabilized within this matrix, causing gram-positive <term class="no-emphasis" id="term-00001">prokaryotes</term> to appear purple under a brightfield microscope after Gram staining. For many years, the retention of Gram stain was one of the main criteria used to classify prokaryotes, even though some prokaryotes did not readily stain with either the primary or secondary stains used in the Gram stain procedure.</para>
<para id="fs-id1172100853611">Advances in nucleic acid biochemistry have revealed additional characteristics that can be used to classify gram-positive prokaryotes, namely the guanine to cytosine ratios (G+C) in DNA and the composition of 16S rRNA subunits. Microbiologists currently recognize two distinct groups of gram-positive, or weakly staining gram-positive, prokaryotes. The class <term class="no-emphasis" id="term-00002">Actinobacteria</term> comprises the <term id="term-00003">high G+C gram-positive bacteria</term>, which have more than 50% guanine and cytosine nucleotides in their DNA.

<title>Actinobacteria: High G+C Gram-Positive Bacteria</title>
<para id="fs-id1172100491480">The name Actinobacteria comes from the Greek words for <emphasis effect="italics">rays</emphasis> and <emphasis effect="italics">small rod</emphasis>, but Actinobacteria are very diverse. Their microscopic appearance can range from thin filamentous branching rods to coccobacilli. Some Actinobacteria are very large and complex, whereas others are among the smallest independently living organisms. Most Actinobacteria live in the soil, but some are aquatic. The vast majority are aerobic. One distinctive feature of this group is the presence of several different peptidoglycans in the cell wall.</para>
<para id="fs-id1172100960744">The genus <term class="no-emphasis" id="term-00006"><emphasis effect="italics">Actinomyces</emphasis></term> is a much studied representative of Actinobacteria. <emphasis effect="italics">Actinomyces</emphasis> spp. play an important role in soil ecology, and some species are human pathogens. A number of <emphasis effect="italics">Actinomyces</emphasis> spp. inhabit the human mouth and are opportunistic pathogens, causing infectious diseases like <term class="no-emphasis" id="term-00007">periodontitis</term> (inflammation of the gums) and oral abscesses.

<para id="fs-id1172098376019">The genus <term class="no-emphasis" id="term-00009"><emphasis effect="italics">Mycobacterium</emphasis></term> is represented by bacilli covered with a mycolic acid coat. This waxy coat protects the bacteria from some antibiotics, prevents them from drying out, and blocks penetration by Gram stain reagents (see <link document="m58788">Staining Microscopic Specimens</link>). Because of this, a special acid-fast staining procedure is used to visualize these bacteria. The genus <emphasis effect="italics">Mycobacterium</emphasis> is an important cause of a diverse group of infectious diseases. <emphasis effect="italics">M. tuberculosis</emphasis> is the causative agent of <term class="no-emphasis" id="term-00010">tuberculosis</term>, a disease that primarily impacts the lungs but can infect other parts of the body as well.

Treatment of <emphasis effect="italics">M. tuberculosis</emphasis> is challenging and requires patients to take a combination of drugs for an extended time.

<para id="fs-id1172100531153">Another pathogenic species, <emphasis effect="italics">M. leprae</emphasis>, is the cause of <term class="no-emphasis" id="term-00011">Hansen’s disease</term> (<term class="no-emphasis" id="term-00012">leprosy</term>), a chronic disease that impacts peripheral nerves and the integrity of the skin and mucosal surface of the respiratory tract.

B. anthracis</emphasis> is the pathogen that causes <term class="no-emphasis" id="term-00059">anthrax</term>, a severe disease that affects wild and domesticated animals and can spread from infected animals to humans. Anthrax manifests in humans as charcoal-black ulcers on the skin, severe enterocolitis, pneumonia, and brain damage due to swelling. If untreated, anthrax is lethal. <emphasis effect="italics">B. cereus</emphasis>, a closely related species, is a pathogen that may cause food poisoning. It is a rod-shaped species that forms chains. Colonies appear milky white with irregular shapes when cultured on blood agar (<link target-id="OSC_Microbio_04_04_Bacillus"/>).

<title>Biopiracy and Bioprospecting</title>
<para id="fs-id1172101034781">In 1969, an employee of a Swiss pharmaceutical company was vacationing in Norway and decided to collect some soil samples. He took them back to his lab, and the Swiss company subsequently used the fungus <emphasis effect="italics">Tolypocladium</emphasis> <emphasis effect="italics">inflatum</emphasis> in those samples to develop cyclosporine A, a drug widely used in patients who undergo tissue or organ transplantation. The Swiss company earns more than $1 billion a year for production of cyclosporine A, yet Norway receives nothing in return—no payment to the government or benefit for the Norwegian people. Despite the fact the cyclosporine A saves numerous lives, many consider the means by which the soil samples were obtained to be an act of “biopiracy,” essentially a form of theft. Do the ends justify the means in a case like this?</para>

Scientists can no longer collect samples without a prior arrangement with the land owner for compensation.
