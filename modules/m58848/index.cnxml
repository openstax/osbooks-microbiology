<para id="fs-id1167741595574">The science of using living systems to benefit humankind is called <term id="term-00001">biotechnology</term>. Technically speaking, the domestication of plants and animals through farming and <term class="no-emphasis" id="term-00002">breeding</term> practices is a type of biotechnology. However, in a contemporary sense, we associate biotechnology with the direct alteration of an organism’s genetics to achieve desirable traits through the process of <term id="term-00003">genetic engineering</term>.

The insulin gene from humans was inserted into a plasmid. This recombinant DNA plasmid was then inserted into bacteria. As a result, these transgenic microbes are able to produce and secrete human insulin. Many prokaryotes are able to acquire foreign DNA and incorporate functional genes into their own genome through “mating” with other cells (<term class="no-emphasis" id="term-00009">conjugation</term>), viral infection (<term class="no-emphasis" id="term-00010">transduction</term>), and taking up DNA from the environment (<term class="no-emphasis" id="term-00011">transformation</term>).

<title>Restriction Enzymes and Ligases</title>
<para id="fs-id1167740417469">In recombinant DNA technology, DNA molecules are manipulated using naturally occurring enzymes derived mainly from bacteria and viruses. The creation of recombinant DNA molecules is possible due to the use of naturally occurring <term id="term-00018">restriction endonucleases</term> (<term id="term-00019">restriction enzymes</term>), bacterial enzymes produced as a protection mechanism to cut and destroy foreign cytoplasmic DNA that is most commonly a result of bacteriophage infection. Stewart <term class="no-emphasis" id="term-00020">Linn</term> and Werner <term class="no-emphasis" id="term-00021">Arber</term> discovered restriction enzymes in their 1960s studies of how <emphasis effect="italics">E. coli</emphasis> limits bacteriophage replication on infection. Today, we use restriction enzymes extensively for cutting DNA fragments that can then be spliced into another DNA molecule to form recombinant molecules. Each restriction enzyme cuts DNA at a characteristic <term id="term-00022">recognition site</term>, a specific, usually palindromic, DNA sequence typically between four to six base pairs in length. A palindrome is a sequence of letters that reads the same forward as backward. (The word “level” is an example of a palindrome.) Palindromic DNA sequences contain the same base sequences in the 5ʹ to 3ʹ direction on one strand as in the 5ʹ to 3ʹ direction on the complementary strand. A restriction enzyme recognizes the DNA palindrome and cuts each backbone at identical positions in the palindrome. Some restriction enzymes cut to produce molecules that have complementary overhangs (<term id="term-00023">sticky ends</term>) while others cut without generating such overhangs, instead producing <term id="term-00024">blunt ends</term> (<link target-id="OSC_Microbio_12_01_Recuts"/>).</para>
<para id="fs-id1167740276081">Molecules with complementary sticky ends can easily <term id="term-00025">anneal</term>, or form hydrogen bonds between complementary bases, at their sticky ends. The annealing step allows <term id="term-00026">hybridization</term> of the single-stranded overhangs. Hybridization refers to the joining together of two complementary single strands of DNA. Blunt ends can also attach together, but less efficiently than sticky ends due to the lack of complementary overhangs facilitating the process. In either case, <term id="term-00027">ligation</term> by <term class="no-emphasis" id="term-00028">DNA ligase</term> can then rejoin the two sugar-phosphate backbones of the DNA through covalent bonding, making the molecule a continuous double strand. In 1972, Paul <term class="no-emphasis" id="term-00029">Berg</term>, a Stanford biochemist, was the first to produce a recombinant DNA molecule using this technique, combining the SV40 monkey virus with <emphasis effect="italics">E. coli</emphasis> bacteriophage lambda to create a hybrid.</para>

After cutting, both strands have a double stranded G/C bond, but then also have single stranded GATC. In blunt end cutting there are no single stranded ends. In this example the enzyme cuts GGCC between the G and the C.">

<title>Plasmids</title>
<para id="fs-id1167740398968">After restriction digestion, genes of interest are commonly inserted into <term class="no-emphasis" id="term-00030">plasmids</term>, small pieces of typically circular, double-stranded DNA that replicate independently of the bacterial chromosome (see <link document="m58792">Unique Characteristics of Prokaryotic Cells</link>). In recombinant DNA technology, plasmids are often used as <term id="term-00031">vectors</term>, DNA molecules that carry DNA fragments from one organism to another. Plasmids used as vectors can be genetically engineered by researchers and scientific supply companies to have specialized properties, as illustrated by the commonly used plasmid vector <term class="no-emphasis" id="term-00032">pUC19</term> (<link target-id="OSC_Microbio_12_01_pUC19"/>). Some <term class="no-emphasis" id="term-00033">plasmid vectors</term> contain genes that confer <term class="no-emphasis" id="term-00034">antibiotic resistance</term>; these resistance genes allow researchers to easily find plasmid-containing colonies by plating them on media containing the corresponding antibiotic. The antibiotic kills all host cells that do not harbor the desired plasmid vector, but those that contain the vector are able to survive and grow.</para>
<para id="fs-id1167741562416">Plasmid vectors used for cloning typically have a <term id="term-00035">polylinker site</term>, or <term id="term-00036">multiple cloning site (MCS)</term>. A polylinker site is a short sequence containing multiple unique restriction enzyme recognition sites that are used for inserting DNA into the plasmid after restriction digestion of both the DNA and the plasmid. Having these multiple restriction enzyme recognition sites within the polylinker site makes the plasmid vector versatile, so it can be used for many different cloning experiments involving different restriction enzymes.</para>
<para id="fs-id1167741683567">This polylinker site is often found within a <term id="term-00037">reporter gene</term>, another gene sequence artificially engineered into the plasmid that encodes a protein that allows for visualization of DNA insertion. The reporter gene allows a researcher to distinguish host cells that contain recombinant plasmids with cloned DNA fragments from host cells that only contain the non-recombinant plasmid vector. The most common reporter gene used in plasmid vectors is the bacterial <term class="no-emphasis" id="term-00038"><emphasis effect="italics">lacZ</emphasis></term> gene encoding beta-galactosidase, an enzyme that naturally degrades lactose but can also degrade a colorless synthetic analog <term class="no-emphasis" id="term-00039">X-gal</term>, thereby producing blue colonies on X-gal–containing media. The <emphasis effect="italics">lacZ</emphasis> reporter gene is disabled when the recombinant DNA is spliced into the plasmid. Because the LacZ protein is not produced when the gene is disabled, X-gal is not degraded and white colonies are produced, which can then be isolated. This <term id="term-00040">blue-white screening</term> method is described later and shown in <link target-id="OSC_Microbio_12_01_MolCloning"/>. In addition to these features, some plasmids come pre-digested and with an enzyme linked to the linearized plasmid to aid in ligation after the insertion of foreign DNA fragments.</para>

<title>Molecular Cloning using Transformation</title>
<para id="fs-id1167741708493">The most commonly used mechanism for introducing engineered plasmids into a bacterial cell is <term class="no-emphasis" id="term-00041">transformation</term>, a process in which bacteria take up free DNA from their surroundings. In nature, free DNA typically comes from other lysed bacterial cells; in the laboratory, free DNA in the form of recombinant plasmids is introduced to the cell’s surroundings.</para>
<para id="fs-id1167741328351">Some bacteria, such as <term class="no-emphasis" id="term-00042"><emphasis effect="italics">Bacillus</emphasis></term> spp., are naturally competent, meaning they are able to take up foreign DNA. However, not all bacteria are naturally competent. In most cases, bacteria must be made artificially competent in the laboratory by increasing the permeability of the cell membrane. This can be achieved through chemical treatments that neutralize charges on the cell membrane or by exposing the bacteria to an electric field that creates microscopic pores in the cell membrane. These methods yield chemically competent or electrocompetent bacteria, respectively.</para>
<para id="fs-id1167741355327">Following the transformation protocol, bacterial cells are plated onto an antibiotic-containing medium to inhibit the growth of the many host cells that were not transformed by the plasmid conferring antibiotic resistance. A technique called <term id="term-00043">blue-white screening</term> is then used for <emphasis effect="italics">lacZ</emphasis>-encoding plasmid vectors such as pUC19. Blue colonies have a functional beta-galactosidase enzyme because the <emphasis effect="italics">lacZ</emphasis> gene is uninterrupted, with no foreign DNA inserted into the polylinker site. These colonies typically result from the digested, linearized plasmid religating to itself. However, white colonies lack a functional beta-galactosidase enzyme, indicating the insertion of foreign DNA within the polylinker site of the plasmid vector, thus disrupting the <emphasis effect="italics">lacZ</emphasis> gene. Thus, white colonies resulting from this blue-white screening contain plasmids with an insert and can be further screened to characterize the foreign DNA. To be sure the correct DNA was incorporated into the plasmid, the DNA insert can then be sequenced.</para>

Recombinant DNA can be transferred by conjugation when bacterial cells containing a recombinant F plasmid are mixed with compatible bacterial cells lacking the plasmid. F plasmids encode a surface structure called an <term class="no-emphasis" id="term-00046">F pilus</term> that facilitates contact between a cell containing an F plasmid and one without an F plasmid. On contact, a cytoplasmic bridge forms between the two cells and the F-plasmid-containing cell replicates its plasmid, transferring a copy of the recombinant F plasmid to the recipient cell.

The restriction enzyme leaves complementary sticky ends on the foreign DNA fragment and the plasmid. This allows the foreign DNA to be inserted into the plasmid when the sticky ends anneal. Adding DNA ligase reattaches the DNA backbones. These are recombinant plasmids. The plasmids are combined with a culture of living bacteria. Many of the bacteria do not take any plasmids into their cells. Many take plasmids that do not have the foreign DNA in them and a few take up the recombinant plasmid. The bacteria that take up the recombinant plasmid cannot make the enzyme from the gene that the fragment was inserted into (lacZ). They also carry a gene for resistance to the antibiotic ampicillin, which was on the original plasmid. To find the bacteria with the recombinant plasmid, the bacteria are grown on a plate with the antibiotic ampicillin and a substance that changes color when exposed to the enzyme produced by the lacZ gene.

<title>Creating a Genomic Library</title>
<para id="fs-id1167741221349">Molecular cloning may also be used to generate a <term id="term-00050">genomic library</term>. The library is a complete (or nearly complete) copy of an organism’s genome contained as recombinant DNA plasmids engineered into unique clones of bacteria. Having such a library allows a researcher to create large quantities of each fragment by growing the bacterial host for that fragment. These fragments can be used to determine the sequence of the DNA and the function of any genes present.</para>
<para id="fs-id1167741312618">One method for generating a genomic library is to ligate individual restriction enzyme-digested genomic fragments into plasmid vectors cut with the same restriction enzyme (<link target-id="OSC_Microbio_12_01_CloneLibry"/>). After transformation into a bacterial host, each transformed bacterial cell takes up a single recombinant plasmid and grows into a colony of cells. All of the cells in this colony are identical <term id="term-00051">clones</term> and carry the same recombinant plasmid. The resulting library is a collection of colonies, each of which contains a fragment of the original organism’s genome, that are each separate and distinct and can each be used for further study. This makes it possible for researchers to screen these different clones to discover the one containing a gene of interest from the original organism’s genome.</para>

Thus, each plaque from a phage library represents a unique recombinant phage containing a distinct genomic DNA fragment. Plaques can then be screened further to look for genes of interest.

<para id="fs-id1167740406915">To focus on the expressed genes in an organism or even a tissue, researchers construct libraries using the organism’s messenger RNA (mRNA) rather than its genomic DNA.

For example, all human cells’ genomic DNA contains the gene for insulin, but only cells in the pancreas express mRNA directing the production of insulin. Because mRNA cannot be cloned directly, in the laboratory mRNA must be used as a template by the retroviral enzyme <term class="no-emphasis" id="term-00054">reverse transcriptase</term> to make <term id="term-00055">complementary DNA (cDNA)</term>. A cell’s full complement of mRNA can be reverse-transcribed into cDNA molecules, which can be used as a template for DNA polymerase to make double-stranded DNA copies; these fragments can subsequently be ligated into either plasmid vectors or bacteriophage to produce a cDNA library. The benefit of a cDNA library is that it contains DNA from only the expressed genes in the cell. This means that the introns, control sequences such as promoters, and DNA not destined to be translated into proteins are not represented in the library. The focus on translated sequences means that the library cannot be used to study the sequence and structure of the genome in its entirety.

The first transgenic plant sold commercially was the <term class="no-emphasis" id="term-00058">Flavr Savr</term> delayed-ripening tomato, which came to market in 1994. Genetically engineered livestock have also been successfully produced, resulting, for example, in pigs with increased nutritional value<footnote id="fs-id1167741210689">Liangxue Lai, Jing X.

<title>Electroporation</title>
<para id="fs-id1167741587800">Compared to bacterial cells, eukaryotic cells tend to be less amenable as hosts for recombinant DNA molecules. Because eukaryotes are typically neither competent to take up foreign DNA nor able to maintain plasmids, transfection of eukaryotic hosts is far more challenging and requires more intrusive techniques for success. One method used for transfecting cells in cell culture is called <term id="term-00059">electroporation</term>. A brief electric pulse induces the formation of transient pores in the phospholipid bilayers of cells through which the gene can be introduced. At the same time, the electric pulse generates a short-lived positive charge on one side of the cell’s interior and a negative charge on the opposite side; the charge difference draws negatively charged DNA molecules into the cell (<link target-id="OSC_Microbio_12_01_electropor"/>).</para>

A cell with a distinct plasma membrane is shown and recombinant DNA is on the outside. The next panel reads: apply the electric pulse; pores form in the cell membrane and the gene enters. The image shows holes in the plasma membrane. Positive charges are inside the holes and negative charges are on the outside. Recombinant DNA pieces move into the cell. The final panel reads: after the electric pulse, the pores reseal and the gene remains in the cell. The diagram shows a continuous plasma membrane again and recombinant DNA both inside and outside the cell. The recombinant DNA inside the cell is labeled “introduced gene”">

<title>Gene Guns</title>
<para id="fs-id1167740202807">Transfecting plant cells can be even more difficult than animal cells because of their thick cell walls. One approach involves treating plant cells with enzymes to remove their cell walls, producing protoplasts.
