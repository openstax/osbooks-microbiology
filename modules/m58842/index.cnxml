<para id="fs-id1167663611366">During the process of <term id="term-00001">transcription</term>, the information encoded within the DNA sequence of one or more genes is transcribed into a strand of RNA, also called an <term id="term-00002">RNA transcript</term>. The resulting single-stranded RNA molecule, composed of ribonucleotides containing the bases adenine (A), cytosine (C), guanine (G), and uracil (U), acts as a mobile molecular copy of the original DNA sequence. Transcription in prokaryotes and in eukaryotes requires the DNA double helix to partially unwind in the region of RNA synthesis. The unwound region is called a <term id="term-00003">transcription bubble</term>. Transcription of a particular gene always proceeds from one of the two DNA strands that acts as a template, the so-called <term id="term-00004">antisense strand</term>. The RNA product is complementary to the template strand of DNA and is almost identical to the nontemplate DNA strand, or the <term id="term-00005">sense strand</term>. The only difference is that in RNA, all of the T nucleotides are replaced with U nucleotides; during RNA synthesis, U is incorporated when there is an A in the complementary antisense strand.</para>
<section id="fs-id1167663983328">
<title>Transcription in Bacteria</title>
<para id="fs-id1167661425017">Bacteria use the same RNA polymerase to transcribe all of their genes. Like DNA polymerase, <term id="term-00006">RNA polymerase</term> adds nucleotides one by one to the 3’-OH group of the growing nucleotide chain. One critical difference in activity between DNA polymerase and RNA polymerase is the requirement for a 3’-OH onto which to add nucleotides: DNA polymerase requires such a 3’-OH group, thus necessitating a primer, whereas RNA polymerase does not. During transcription, a ribonucleotide complementary to the DNA template strand is added to the growing RNA strand and a covalent phosphodiester bond is formed by dehydration synthesis between the new nucleotide and the last one added. In <emphasis effect="italics">E. coli</emphasis>, RNA polymerase comprises six polypeptide subunits, five of which compose the polymerase core enzyme responsible for adding RNA nucleotides to a growing strand. The sixth subunit is known as sigma (σ). The <term class="no-emphasis" id="term-00007">σ factor</term> enables RNA polymerase to bind to a specific promoter, thus allowing for the transcription of various genes. There are various σ factors that allow for transcription of various genes.</para>
<section id="fs-id1167661736568">
<title>Initiation</title>
<para id="fs-id1167661640080">The <term id="term-00008">initiation of transcription</term> begins at a <term id="term-00009">promoter</term>, a DNA sequence onto which the transcription machinery binds and initiates transcription. The nucleotide pair in the DNA double helix that corresponds to the site from which the first 5’ RNA nucleotide is transcribed is the initiation site. Nucleotides preceding the initiation site are designated “upstream,” whereas nucleotides following the initiation site are called “downstream” nucleotides. In most cases, promoters are located just upstream of the genes they regulate. <sup/>Although promoter sequences vary among bacterial genomes, a few elements are conserved. At the –10 and –35 positions within the DNA prior to the initiation site (designated +1), there are two promoter consensus sequences, or regions that are similar across all promoters and across various bacterial species. The –10 consensus sequence, called the <term class="no-emphasis" id="term-00010">TATA box</term>, is TATAAT. The –35 sequence is recognized and bound by σ.</para>

<section id="fs-id1167661426115">
<title>Elongation</title>
<para id="fs-id1167663900275">The <term id="term-00011">elongation in transcription</term> phase begins when the σ subunit dissociates from the polymerase, allowing the core enzyme to synthesize RNA complementary to the DNA template in a 5’ to 3’ direction at a rate of approximately 40 nucleotides per second. As elongation proceeds, the DNA is continuously unwound ahead of the core enzyme and rewound behind it (<link target-id="OSC_Microbio_11_03_TxnElong"/>).</para>

<title>Termination</title>
<para id="fs-id1167663874406">Once a gene is transcribed, the bacterial polymerase must dissociate from the DNA template and liberate the newly made RNA. This is referred to as <term id="term-00012">termination of transcription</term>. The DNA template includes repeated nucleotide sequences that act as termination signals, causing RNA polymerase to stall and release from the DNA template, freeing the RNA transcript.</para>

<title>Transcription in Eukaryotes</title>
<para id="fs-id1167663931135">Prokaryotes and eukaryotes perform fundamentally the same process of transcription, with a few significant differences (see <link target-id="fs-id1167663533154"/>). Eukaryotes use three different polymerases, RNA polymerases I, II, and III, all structurally distinct from the bacterial <term class="no-emphasis" id="term-00013">RNA polymerase</term>. Each transcribes a different subset of genes. Interestingly, <term class="no-emphasis" id="term-00014">archaea</term> contain a single RNA polymerase that is more closely related to eukaryotic RNA polymerase II than to its bacterial counterpart. Eukaryotic mRNAs are also usually monocistronic, meaning that they each encode only a single polypeptide, whereas prokaryotic mRNAs of bacteria and archaea are commonly <term id="term-00015">polycistronic</term>, meaning that they encode multiple polypeptides.</para>
<para id="fs-id1167661553422">The most important difference between prokaryotes and eukaryotes is the latter’s membrane-bound nucleus, which influences the ease of use of RNA molecules for protein synthesis. With the genes bound in a nucleus, the eukaryotic cell must transport protein-encoding RNA molecules to the cytoplasm to be translated. Protein-encoding <term id="term-00016">primary transcript</term>s, the RNA molecules directly synthesized by RNA polymerase, must undergo several processing steps to protect these RNA molecules from degradation during the time they are transferred from the nucleus to the cytoplasm and translated into a protein. For example, eukaryotic mRNAs may last for several hours, whereas the typical prokaryotic mRNA lasts no more than 5 seconds.</para>
<para id="fs-id1167661287679">The <term class="no-emphasis" id="term-00017">primary transcript</term> (also called pre-mRNA) is first coated with RNA-stabilizing proteins to protect it from degradation while it is processed and exported out of the nucleus. The first type of processing begins while the primary transcript is still being synthesized; a special 7-methylguanosine nucleotide, called the <term id="term-00018">5’ cap</term>, is added to the 5’ end of the growing transcript. In addition to preventing degradation, factors involved in subsequent protein synthesis recognize the cap, which helps initiate translation by ribosomes. Once elongation is complete, another processing enzyme then adds a string of approximately 200 adenine nucleotides to the 3’ end, called the <term id="term-00019">poly-A tail</term>. This modification further protects the pre-mRNA from degradation and signals to cellular factors that the transcript needs to be exported to the cytoplasm.</para>
<para id="fs-id1167661780937">Eukaryotic genes that encode polypeptides are composed of coding sequences called <term id="term-00020">exon</term>s (<emphasis effect="italics">ex</emphasis>-on signifies that they are <emphasis effect="italics">ex</emphasis>pressed) and intervening sequences called <term id="term-00021">intron</term>s (<emphasis effect="italics">int</emphasis>-ron denotes their <emphasis effect="italics">int</emphasis>ervening role). Transcribed RNA sequences corresponding to introns do not encode regions of the functional polypeptide and are removed from the pre-mRNA during processing. It is essential that all of the intron-encoded RNA sequences are completely and precisely removed from a pre-mRNA before protein synthesis so that the exon-encoded RNA sequences are properly joined together to code for a functional polypeptide. If the process errs by even a single nucleotide, the sequences of the rejoined exons would be shifted, and the resulting polypeptide would be nonfunctional. The process of removing intron-encoded RNA sequences and reconnecting those encoded by exons is called <term id="term-00022">RNA splicing</term> and is facilitated by the action of a <term id="term-00023">spliceosome</term> containing small nuclear ribonucleo proteins (snRNPs). Intron-encoded RNA sequences are removed from the pre-mRNA while it is still in the nucleus. Although they are not translated, introns appear to have various functions, including gene regulation and mRNA transport. On completion of these modifications, the <term class="no-emphasis" id="term-00024">mature transcript</term>, the mRNA that encodes a polypeptide, is transported out of the nucleus, destined for the cytoplasm for translation. Introns can be spliced out differently, resulting in various exons being included or excluded from the final mRNA product. This process is known as <term class="no-emphasis" id="term-00025">alternative splicing</term>. The advantage of alternative splicing is that different types of mRNA transcripts can be generated, all derived from the same DNA sequence. In recent years, it has been shown that some archaea also have the ability to splice their pre-mRNA.</para>
