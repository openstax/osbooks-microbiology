</section>
<para id="fs-id1167663960293">Because fungi, protozoa, and helminths are eukaryotic, their cells are very similar to human cells, making it more difficult to develop drugs with selective toxicity. Additionally, viruses replicate within human host cells, making it difficult to develop drugs that are selectively toxic to viruses or virus-infected cells. Despite these challenges, there are antimicrobial drugs that target fungi, protozoa, helminths, and viruses, and some even target more than one type of microbe. <link target-id="fs-id1167661598303"/>, <link target-id="fs-id1167661428546"/>, <link target-id="fs-id1167663731038"/>, and <link target-id="fs-id1167661791415"/> provide examples for antimicrobial drugs in these various classes.</para>

<title>Antifungal Drugs</title>
<para id="fs-id1167663635524">The most common mode of action for <term class="no-emphasis" id="term-00001">antifungal drugs</term> is the disruption of the cell membrane. Antifungals take advantage of small differences between fungi and humans in the biochemical pathways that synthesize sterols. The <term class="no-emphasis" id="term-00002">sterols</term> are important in maintaining proper membrane fluidity and, hence, proper function of the cell membrane. For most fungi, the predominant membrane sterol is <term class="no-emphasis" id="term-00003">ergosterol</term>. Because human cell membranes use <term class="no-emphasis" id="term-00004">cholesterol</term>, instead of ergosterol, antifungal drugs that target ergosterol synthesis are selectively toxic (<link target-id="OSC_Microbio_14_03_sterols"/>).</para>

<caption>The predominant sterol found in human cells is cholesterol, whereas the predominant sterol found in fungi is ergosterol, making ergosterol a good target for antifungal drug development.</caption>

<para id="fs-id1167663652758">The <term id="term-00005">imidazoles</term> are synthetic fungicides that disrupt ergosterol biosynthesis; they are commonly used in medical applications and also in agriculture to keep seeds and harvested crops from molding. Examples include <term class="no-emphasis" id="term-00006">miconazole</term>, <term class="no-emphasis" id="term-00007">ketoconazole</term>, and <term class="no-emphasis" id="term-00008">clotrimazole</term>, which are used to treat fungal skin infections such as <term class="no-emphasis" id="term-00009">ringworm</term>, specifically <term class="no-emphasis" id="term-00010">tinea pedis</term> (<term class="no-emphasis" id="term-00011">athlete’s foot</term>), <term class="no-emphasis" id="term-00012">tinea cruris</term> (<term class="no-emphasis" id="term-00013">jock itch</term>), and <term class="no-emphasis" id="term-00014">tinea corporis</term>. These infections are commonly caused by <term class="no-emphasis" id="term-00015">dermatophytes</term> of the genera <term class="no-emphasis" id="term-00016"><emphasis effect="italics">Trichophyton</emphasis></term>, <term class="no-emphasis" id="term-00017"><emphasis effect="italics">Epidermophyton</emphasis></term>, and <term class="no-emphasis" id="term-00018"><emphasis effect="italics">Microsporum</emphasis></term>. Miconazole is also used predominantly for the treatment of vaginal yeast infections caused by the fungus <term class="no-emphasis" id="term-00019"><emphasis effect="italics">Candida</emphasis></term>, and ketoconazole is used for the treatment of <term class="no-emphasis" id="term-00020">tinea versicolor</term> and <term class="no-emphasis" id="term-00021">dandruff</term>, which both can be caused by the fungus <term class="no-emphasis" id="term-00022"><emphasis effect="italics">Malassezia</emphasis></term>.</para>
<para id="fs-id1167661485633">The <term id="term-00023">triazole</term> drugs, including <term id="term-00024">fluconazole</term>, also inhibit <term class="no-emphasis" id="term-00025">ergosterol</term> biosynthesis. However, they can be administered orally or intravenously for the treatment of several types of systemic yeast infections, including <term class="no-emphasis" id="term-00026">oral thrush</term> and <term class="no-emphasis" id="term-00027">cryptococcal meningitis</term>, both of which are prevalent in patients with AIDS. The triazoles also exhibit more <term class="no-emphasis" id="term-00028">selective toxicity</term>, compared with the imidazoles, and are associated with fewer side effects.</para>
<para id="fs-id1167663715006">The <term id="term-00029">allylamines</term>, a structurally different class of synthetic antifungal drugs, inhibit an earlier step in ergosterol biosynthesis. The most commonly used allylamine is <term id="term-00030">terbinafine</term> (marketed under the brand name <term class="no-emphasis" id="term-00031">Lamisil</term>), which is used topically for the treatment of dermatophytic skin infections like <term class="no-emphasis" id="term-00032">athlete’s foot</term>, <term class="no-emphasis" id="term-00033">ringworm</term>, and <term class="no-emphasis" id="term-00034">jock itch</term>. Oral treatment with terbinafine is also used for the treatment of fingernail and toenail fungus, but it can be associated with the rare side effect of <term class="no-emphasis" id="term-00035">hepatotoxicity</term>.</para>
<para id="fs-id1167661456640">The <term id="term-00036">polyenes</term> are a class of antifungal agents naturally produced by certain actinomycete soil bacteria and are structurally related to <term class="no-emphasis" id="term-00037">macrolides</term>. These large, lipophilic molecules bind to ergosterol in fungal cytoplasmic membranes, thus creating pores. Common examples include <term class="no-emphasis" id="term-00038">nystatin</term> and <term class="no-emphasis" id="term-00039">amphotericin B</term>. Nystatin is typically used as a topical treatment for yeast infections of the skin, mouth, and vagina, but may also be used for intestinal fungal infections. The drug <term id="term-00040">amphotericin B</term> is used for systemic fungal infections like <term class="no-emphasis" id="term-00041">aspergillosis</term>, <term class="no-emphasis" id="term-00042">cryptococcal meningitis</term>, <term class="no-emphasis" id="term-00043">histoplasmosis</term>, <term class="no-emphasis" id="term-00044">blastomycosis</term>, and <term class="no-emphasis" id="term-00045">candidiasis</term>. Amphotericin B was the only antifungal drug available for several decades, but its use is associated with some serious side effects, including <term class="no-emphasis" id="term-00046">nephrotoxicity</term> (kidney toxicity).</para>
<para id="fs-id1167663656458">Amphotericin B is often used in combination with <term class="no-emphasis" id="term-00047">flucytosine</term>, a fluorinated pyrimidine analog that is converted by a fungal-specific enzyme into a toxic product that interferes with both DNA replication and protein synthesis in fungi. Flucytosine is also associated with hepatotoxicity (liver toxicity) and bone marrow depression.</para>
<para id="fs-id1167661438818">Beyond targeting <term class="no-emphasis" id="term-00048">ergosterol</term> in fungal cell membranes, there are a few antifungal drugs that target other fungal structures (<link target-id="OSC_Microbio_14_03_antifungal"/>). The <term class="no-emphasis" id="term-00049">echinocandins</term>, including caspofungin, are a group of naturally produced antifungal compounds that block the synthesis of β(1→3) glucan found in fungal cell walls but not found in human cells. This drug class has the nickname “penicillin for fungi.” Caspofungin is used for the treatment of <term class="no-emphasis" id="term-00050">aspergillosis</term> as well as systemic yeast infections.</para>
<para id="fs-id1167661742330">Although <term class="no-emphasis" id="term-00051">chitin</term> is only a minor constituent of fungal cell walls, it is also absent in human cells, making it a selective target. The <term class="no-emphasis" id="term-00052">polyoxins</term> and <term class="no-emphasis" id="term-00053">nikkomycins</term> are naturally produced antifungals that target chitin synthesis. Polyoxins are used to control fungi for agricultural purposes, and nikkomycin Z is currently under development for use in humans to treat yeast infections and <term class="no-emphasis" id="term-00054">Valley fever</term> (<term class="no-emphasis" id="term-00055">coccidioidomycosis</term>), a fungal disease prevalent in the southwestern US.<footnote id="fs-id1167663875228">Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. “Valley Fever: Awareness Is Key.” http://www.cdc.gov/features/valleyfever/. Accessed June 1, 2016.</footnote></para>
<para id="fs-id1167663712736">The naturally produced antifungal <term class="no-emphasis" id="term-00056">griseofulvin</term> is thought to specifically disrupt fungal cell division by interfering with microtubules involved in spindle formation during mitosis. It was one of the first antifungals, but its use is associated with <term class="no-emphasis" id="term-00057">hepatotoxicity</term>. It is typically administered orally to treat various types of dermatophytic skin infections when other topical antifungal treatments are ineffective.</para>
<para id="fs-id1167663508198">There are a few drugs that act as antimetabolites against fungal processes. For example, <term class="no-emphasis" id="term-00058">atovaquone</term>, a representative of the <term class="no-emphasis" id="term-00059">naphthoquinone</term> drug class, is a semisynthetic antimetabolite for fungal and protozoal versions of a mitochondrial cytochrome important in electron transport. Structurally, it is an analog of <term class="no-emphasis" id="term-00060">coenzyme Q</term>, with which it competes for electron binding. It is particularly useful for the treatment of <term class="no-emphasis" id="term-00061"><emphasis effect="italics">Pneumocystis</emphasis> pneumonia</term> caused by <term class="no-emphasis" id="term-00062"><emphasis effect="italics">Pneumocystis jirovecii</emphasis></term>.

<title>Treating a Fungal Infection of the Lungs</title>
<para id="fs-id1167663647680">Jack, a 48-year-old engineer, is <term class="no-emphasis" id="term-00064">HIV</term> positive but generally healthy thanks to <term class="no-emphasis" id="term-00065">antiretroviral therapy (ART)</term>. However, after a particularly intense week at work, he developed a fever and a dry cough. He assumed that he just had a cold or mild flu due to overexertion and didn’t think much of it. However, after about a week, he began to experience fatigue, weight loss, and shortness of breath. He decided to visit his physician, who found that Jack had a low level of blood oxygenation. The physician ordered blood testing, a chest X-ray, and the collection of an induced sputum sample for analysis. His X-ray showed a fine cloudiness and several pneumatoceles (thin-walled pockets of air), which indicated <term class="no-emphasis" id="term-00066"><emphasis effect="italics">Pneumocystis</emphasis> pneumonia</term> (PCP), a type of pneumonia caused by the fungus <term class="no-emphasis" id="term-00067"><emphasis effect="italics">Pneumocystis jirovecii</emphasis></term>. Jack’s physician admitted him to the hospital and prescribed <term class="no-emphasis" id="term-00068">Bactrim</term>, a combination of <term class="no-emphasis" id="term-00069">sulfamethoxazole</term> and <term class="no-emphasis" id="term-00070">trimethoprim</term>, to be administered intravenously.</para>
<para id="fs-id1167661268012"><emphasis effect="italics">P. jirovecii</emphasis> is a yeast-like fungus with a life cycle similar to that of protozoans. As such, it was classified as a protozoan until the 1980s. It lives only in the lung tissue of infected persons and is transmitted from person to person, with many people exposed as children. Typically, <emphasis effect="italics">P. jirovecii</emphasis> only causes pneumonia in immunocompromised individuals. Healthy people may carry the fungus in their lungs with no symptoms of disease. PCP is particularly problematic among HIV patients with compromised immune systems.</para>
<para id="fs-id1167661432383">PCP is usually treated with oral or intravenous Bactrim, but <term class="no-emphasis" id="term-00071">atovaquone</term> or <term class="no-emphasis" id="term-00072">pentamidine</term> (another antiparasitic drug) are alternatives. If not treated, PCP can progress, leading to a collapsed lung and nearly 100% mortality. Even with antimicrobial drug therapy, PCP still is responsible for 10% of HIV-related deaths.</para>
<para id="fs-id1167663970848">The cytological examination, using direct immunofluorescence assay (DFA), of a smear from Jack’s sputum sample confirmed the presence of <emphasis effect="italics">P. jirovecii</emphasis> (<link target-id="OSC_Microbio_14_03_Pjiroveci"/>). Additionally, the results of Jack’s blood tests revealed that his white blood cell count had dipped, making him more susceptible to the fungus. His physician reviewed his ART regimen and made adjustments. After a few days of hospitalization, Jack was released to continue his antimicrobial therapy at home. With the adjustments to his ART therapy, Jack’s CD4 counts began to increase and he was able to go back to work.</para>

<title>Antiprotozoan Drugs</title>
<para id="fs-id1167663741367">There are a few mechanisms by which antiprotozoan drugs target infectious protozoans (<link target-id="fs-id1167663731038"/>). Some are <term class="no-emphasis" id="term-00073">antimetabolites</term>, such as <term class="no-emphasis" id="term-00074">atovaquone</term>, <term class="no-emphasis" id="term-00075">proguanil</term>, and artemisinins. Atovaquone, in addition to being antifungal, blocks electron transport in protozoans and is used for the treatment of protozoan infections including <term class="no-emphasis" id="term-00076">malaria</term>, <term class="no-emphasis" id="term-00077">babesiosis</term>, and <term class="no-emphasis" id="term-00078">toxoplasmosis</term>. Proguanil is another synthetic antimetabolite that is processed in parasitic cells into its active form, which inhibits protozoan folic acid synthesis. It is often used in combination with atovaquone, and the combination is marketed as <term class="no-emphasis" id="term-00079">Malarone</term> for both malaria treatment and prevention.</para>
<para id="fs-id1167661292501">Artemisinin, a plant-derived antifungal first discovered by Tu Youyou and other Chinese scientists in the 1970s, is quite effective against malaria. Semisynthetic derivatives of <term id="term-00080">artemisinin</term> are more water soluble than the natural version, which makes them more bioavailable. Although the exact mechanism of action is unclear, artemisinins appear to act as prodrugs that are metabolized by target cells to produce <term class="no-emphasis" id="term-00081">reactive oxygen species (ROS)</term> that damage target cells. Due to the rise in resistance to antimalarial drugs, artemisinins are also commonly used in combination with other antimalarial compounds in artemisinin-based combination therapy (ACT).</para>
<para id="fs-id1167661280383">Several antimetabolites are used for the treatment of toxoplasmosis caused by the parasite <term class="no-emphasis" id="term-00082"><emphasis effect="italics">Toxoplasma gondii</emphasis></term>. The synthetic sulfa drug <term class="no-emphasis" id="term-00083">sulfadiazine</term> competitively inhibits an enzyme in <term class="no-emphasis" id="term-00084">folic acid</term> production in parasites and can be used to treat malaria and toxoplasmosis. Pyrimethamine is a synthetic drug that inhibits a different enzyme in the folic acid production pathway and is often used in combination with <term class="no-emphasis" id="term-00085">sulfadoxine</term> (another sulfa drug) for the treatment of <term class="no-emphasis" id="term-00086">malaria</term> or in combination with sulfadiazine for the treatment of <term class="no-emphasis" id="term-00087">toxoplasmosis</term>. Side effects of <term class="no-emphasis" id="term-00088">pyrimethamine</term> include decreased bone marrow activity that may cause increased bruising and low red blood cell counts. When toxicity is a concern, <term class="no-emphasis" id="term-00089">spiramycin</term>, a macrolide protein synthesis inhibitor, is typically administered for the treatment of toxoplasmosis.</para>
<para id="fs-id1167659397707">Two classes of antiprotozoan drugs interfere with nucleic acid synthesis: <term class="no-emphasis" id="term-00090">nitroimidazoles</term> and <term class="no-emphasis" id="term-00091">quinolines</term>. Nitroimidazoles, including semisynthetic <term class="no-emphasis" id="term-00092">metronidazole</term>, which was discussed previously as an antibacterial drug, and synthetic <term class="no-emphasis" id="term-00093">tinidazole</term>, are useful in combating a wide variety of protozoan pathogens, such as <term class="no-emphasis" id="term-00094"><emphasis effect="italics">Giardia lamblia</emphasis></term>, <term class="no-emphasis" id="term-00095"><emphasis effect="italics">Entamoeba histolytica</emphasis></term>, and <term class="no-emphasis" id="term-00096"><emphasis effect="italics">Trichomonas vaginalis</emphasis></term>. Upon introduction into these cells in low-oxygen environments, nitroimidazoles become activated and introduce DNA strand breakage, interfering with DNA replication in target cells. Unfortunately, metronidazole is associated with <term class="no-emphasis" id="term-00097">carcinogenesis</term> (the development of cancer) in humans.</para>
<para id="fs-id1167661506634">Another type of synthetic antiprotozoan drug that has long been thought to specifically interfere with DNA replication in certain pathogens is <term id="term-00098">pentamidine</term>. It has historically been used for the treatment of <term class="no-emphasis" id="term-00099">African sleeping sickness</term> (caused by the protozoan <term class="no-emphasis" id="term-00100"><emphasis effect="italics">Trypanosoma brucei</emphasis></term>) and <term class="no-emphasis" id="term-00101">leishmaniasis</term> (caused by protozoa of the genus <term class="no-emphasis" id="term-00102"><emphasis effect="italics">Leishmania</emphasis></term>), but it is also an alternative treatment for the fungus <term class="no-emphasis" id="term-00103"><emphasis effect="italics">Pneumocystis</emphasis></term>. Some studies indicate that it specifically binds to the DNA found within <term class="no-emphasis" id="term-00104">kinetoplasts</term> (kDNA; long mitochondrion-like structures unique to <term class="no-emphasis" id="term-00105">trypanosomes</term>), leading to the cleavage of kDNA. However, nuclear DNA of both the parasite and host remain unaffected. It also appears to bind to tRNA, inhibiting the addition of amino acids to tRNA, thus preventing protein synthesis. Possible side effects of pentamidine use include pancreatic dysfunction and liver damage.</para>
<para id="fs-id1167663919800">The <term id="term-00106">quinolines</term> are a class of synthetic compounds related to <term class="no-emphasis" id="term-00107">quinine</term>, which has a long history of use against malaria. Quinolines are thought to interfere with heme detoxification, which is necessary for the parasite’s effective breakdown of hemoglobin into amino acids inside red blood cells.

<title>Antihelminthic Drugs</title>
<para id="fs-id1167663641846">Because helminths are multicellular eukaryotes like humans, developing drugs with selective toxicity against them is extremely challenging. Despite this, several effective classes have been developed (<link target-id="fs-id1167663731038"/>). Synthetic <term id="term-00113">benzimidazoles</term>, like <term id="term-00114">mebendazole</term> and <term id="term-00115">albendazole</term>, bind to helminthic β-tubulin, preventing microtubule formation. Microtubules in the intestinal cells of the worms seem to be particularly affected, leading to a reduction in glucose uptake. Besides their activity against a broad range of helminths, benzimidazoles are also active against many protozoans, fungi, and viruses, and their use for inhibiting mitosis and cell cycle progression in cancer cells is under study.<footnote id="fs-id1167663992618">B. Chu et al. “A Benzimidazole Derivative Exhibiting Antitumor Activity Blocks EGFR and HER2 Activity and Upregulates DR5 in Breast Cancer Cells.” <emphasis effect="italics">Cell Death and Disease</emphasis> 6 (2015):e1686</footnote> Possible side effects of their use include liver damage and bone marrow suppression.</para>
<para id="fs-id1167663591247">The <term class="no-emphasis" id="term-00116">avermectins</term> are members of the macrolide family that were first discovered from a Japanese soil isolate, <term class="no-emphasis" id="term-00117"><emphasis effect="italics">Streptomyces avermectinius</emphasis></term>. A more potent semisynthetic derivative of avermectin is <term id="term-00118">ivermectin</term>, which binds to glutamate-gated chloride channels specific to invertebrates including helminths, blocking neuronal transmission and causing starvation, paralysis, and death of the worms. Ivermectin is used to treat roundworm diseases, including <term class="no-emphasis" id="term-00119">onchocerciasis</term> (also called <term class="no-emphasis" id="term-00120">river blindness</term>, caused by the worm <term class="no-emphasis" id="term-00121"><emphasis effect="italics">Onchocerca volvulus</emphasis></term>) and <term class="no-emphasis" id="term-00122">strongyloidiasis</term> (caused by the worm <term class="no-emphasis" id="term-00123"><emphasis effect="italics">Strongyloides stercoralis</emphasis></term> or <emphasis effect="italics">S. fuelleborni</emphasis>). Ivermectin also can also treat parasitic insects like mites, lice, and bed bugs, and is nontoxic to humans.</para>
<para id="fs-id1167661256820">Niclosamide is a synthetic drug that has been used for over 50 years to treat <term class="no-emphasis" id="term-00124">tapeworm</term> infections. Although its mode of action is not entirely clear, <term class="no-emphasis" id="term-00125">niclosamide</term> appears to inhibit ATP formation under anaerobic conditions and inhibit oxidative phosphorylation in the mitochondria of its target pathogens. Niclosamide is not absorbed from the gastrointestinal tract, thus it can achieve high localized intestinal concentrations in patients. Recently, it has been shown to also have antibacterial, antiviral, and antitumor activities.<footnote id="fs-id1167663988212">J.-X. Pan et al. “Niclosamide, An Old Antihelminthic Agent, Demonstrates Antitumor Activity by Blocking Multiple Signaling Pathways of Cancer Stem Cells.” <emphasis effect="italics">Chinese Journal of Cancer</emphasis> 31 no. 4 (2012):178–184.</footnote><footnote id="fs-id1167661615744">F.

<para id="fs-id1167661752244">Another synthetic antihelminthic drug is <term id="term-00126">praziquantel</term>, which used for the treatment of parasitic tapeworms and <term class="no-emphasis" id="term-00127">liver flukes</term>, and is particularly useful for the treatment of <term class="no-emphasis" id="term-00128">schistosomiasis</term> (caused by <term class="no-emphasis" id="term-00129">blood flukes</term> from three genera of <term class="no-emphasis" id="term-00130"><emphasis effect="italics">Schistosoma</emphasis></term>). Its mode of action remains unclear, but it appears to cause the influx of calcium into the worm, resulting in intense spasm and paralysis of the worm. It is often used as a preferred alternative to niclosamide in the treatment of tapeworms when gastrointestinal discomfort limits niclosamide use.</para>
<para id="fs-id1167661480798">The <term class="no-emphasis" id="term-00131">thioxanthenones</term>, another class of synthetic drugs structurally related to <term class="no-emphasis" id="term-00132">quinine</term>, exhibit antischistosomal activity by inhibiting RNA synthesis. The thioxanthenone <term class="no-emphasis" id="term-00133">lucanthone</term> and its metabolite <term class="no-emphasis" id="term-00134">hycanthone</term> were the first used clinically, but serious neurological, gastrointestinal, cardiovascular, and hepatic side effects led to their discontinuation.

<title>Antiviral Drugs</title>
<para id="fs-id1167663639544">Unlike the complex structure of fungi, protozoa, and helminths, viral structure is simple, consisting of nucleic acid, a protein coat, viral enzymes, and, sometimes, a lipid envelope. Furthermore, viruses are obligate intracellular pathogens that use the host’s cellular machinery to replicate. These characteristics make it difficult to develop drugs with selective toxicity against viruses.</para>
<para id="fs-id1167663724023">Many antiviral drugs are nucleoside analogs and function by inhibiting nucleic acid biosynthesis. For example, <term id="term-00136">acyclovir</term> (marketed as <term class="no-emphasis" id="term-00137">Zovirax</term>) is a synthetic analog of the nucleoside <term class="no-emphasis" id="term-00138">guanosine</term> (<link target-id="OSC_Microbio_14_03_Acyclovir"/>). It is activated by the herpes simplex viral enzyme thymidine kinase and, when added to a growing DNA strand during replication, causes chain termination. Its specificity for virus-infected cells comes from both the need for a viral enzyme to activate it and the increased affinity of the activated form for viral DNA polymerase compared to host cell DNA polymerase. Acyclovir and its derivatives are frequently used for the treatment of <term class="no-emphasis" id="term-00139">herpes virus</term> infections, including <term class="no-emphasis" id="term-00140">genital herpes</term>, <term class="no-emphasis" id="term-00141">chickenpox</term>, <term class="no-emphasis" id="term-00142">shingles</term>, <term class="no-emphasis" id="term-00143">Epstein-Barr virus</term> infections, and <term class="no-emphasis" id="term-00144">cytomegalovirus</term> infections. Acyclovir can be administered either topically or systemically, depending on the infection. One possible side effect of its use includes <term class="no-emphasis" id="term-00145">nephrotoxicity</term>. The drug <term class="no-emphasis" id="term-00146">adenine-arabinoside</term>, marketed as <term class="no-emphasis" id="term-00147">vidarabine</term>, is a synthetic analog to <term class="no-emphasis" id="term-00148">deoxyadenosine</term> that has a mechanism of action similar to that of acyclovir. It is also effective for the treatment of various human herpes viruses. However, because of possible side effects involving low white blood cell counts and <term class="no-emphasis" id="term-00149">neurotoxicity</term>, treatment with acyclovir is now preferred.</para>
<para id="fs-id1167661281817">Ribavirin, another synthetic <term class="no-emphasis" id="term-00150">guanosine</term> analog, works by a mechanism of action that is not entirely clear. It appears to interfere with both DNA and RNA synthesis, perhaps by reducing intracellular pools of <term class="no-emphasis" id="term-00151">guanosine triphosphate</term> (GTP). Ribavarin also appears to inhibit the RNA polymerase of <term class="no-emphasis" id="term-00152">hepatitis C</term> virus. It is primarily used for the treatment of the RNA viruses like hepatitis C (in combination therapy with interferon) and <term class="no-emphasis" id="term-00153">respiratory syncytial virus</term>. Possible side effects of <term class="no-emphasis" id="term-00154">ribavirin</term> use include <term class="no-emphasis" id="term-00155">anemia</term> and developmental effects on unborn children in pregnant patients. In recent years, another nucleotide analog, <term class="no-emphasis" id="term-00156">sofosbuvir</term> (<term class="no-emphasis" id="term-00157">Solvaldi</term>), has also been developed for the treatment of hepatitis C. Sofosbuvir is a <term class="no-emphasis" id="term-00158">uridine</term> analog that interferes with viral polymerase activity. It is commonly coadministered with ribavirin, with and without <term class="no-emphasis" id="term-00159">interferon</term>.</para>
<para id="fs-id1167661424668">Inhibition of nucleic acid synthesis is not the only target of synthetic antivirals. Although the mode of action of <term id="term-00160">amantadine</term> and its relative <term id="term-00161">rimantadine</term> are not entirely clear, these drugs appear to bind to a transmembrane protein that is involved in the escape of the <term class="no-emphasis" id="term-00162">influenza virus</term> from endosomes. Blocking escape of the virus also prevents viral RNA release into host cells and subsequent viral replication. Increasing resistance has limited the use of amantadine and rimantadine in the treatment of influenza A. Use of amantadine can result in neurological side effects, but the side effects of rimantadine seem less severe. Interestingly, because of their effects on brain chemicals such as dopamine and NMDA (N-methyl D-aspartate), amantadine and rimantadine are also used for the treatment of <term class="no-emphasis" id="term-00163">Parkinson’s disease</term>.</para>
<para id="fs-id1167661427819">Neuraminidase inhibitors, including <term class="no-emphasis" id="term-00164">olsetamivir</term> (<term class="no-emphasis" id="term-00165">Tamiflu</term>), <term class="no-emphasis" id="term-00166">zanamivir</term> (<term class="no-emphasis" id="term-00167">Relenza</term>), and <term class="no-emphasis" id="term-00168">peramivir</term> (<term class="no-emphasis" id="term-00169">Rapivab</term>), specifically target influenza viruses by blocking the activity of influenza virus <term class="no-emphasis" id="term-00170">neuraminidase</term>, preventing the release of the virus from infected cells. These three antivirals can decrease flu symptoms and shorten the duration of illness, but they differ in their modes of administration: olsetamivir is administered orally, zanamivir is inhaled, and peramivir is administered intravenously. Resistance to these neuraminidase inhibitors still seems to be minimal.</para>
<para id="fs-id1167663727203">Pleconaril is a synthetic antiviral under development that showed promise for the treatment of <term class="no-emphasis" id="term-00171">picornaviruses</term>. Use of <term id="term-00172">pleconaril</term> for the treatment of the common cold caused by <term class="no-emphasis" id="term-00173">rhinoviruses</term> was not approved by the FDA in 2002 because of lack of proven effectiveness, lack of stability, and association with irregular menstruation. Its further development for this purpose was halted in 2007. However, pleconaril is still being investigated for use in the treatment of life-threatening complications of <term class="no-emphasis" id="term-00174">enteroviruses</term>, such as <term class="no-emphasis" id="term-00175">meningitis</term> and <term class="no-emphasis" id="term-00176">sepsis</term>. It is also being investigated for use in the global eradication of a specific enterovirus, <term class="no-emphasis" id="term-00177">polio</term>.<footnote id="fs-id1167661370220">M.J. Abzug. “The Enteroviruses: Problems in Need of Treatments.” <emphasis effect="italics">Journal of Infection</emphasis> 68 no. S1 (2014):108–14.</footnote> Pleconaril seems to work by binding to the viral capsid and preventing the uncoating of viral particles inside host cells during viral infection.</para>
<para id="fs-id1167661731212">Viruses with complex life cycles, such as <term class="no-emphasis" id="term-00178">HIV</term>, can be more difficult to treat. First, HIV targets CD4-positive white blood cells, which are necessary for a normal immune response to infection. Second, HIV is a <term class="no-emphasis" id="term-00179">retrovirus</term>, meaning that it converts its RNA genome into a DNA copy that integrates into the host cell’s genome, thus hiding within host cell DNA. Third, the HIV reverse transcriptase lacks proofreading activity and introduces mutations that allow for rapid development of antiviral drug resistance. To help prevent the emergence of resistance, a combination of specific synthetic antiviral drugs is typically used in ART for HIV (<link target-id="OSC_Microbio_14_03_ART"/>).</para>
<para id="fs-id1167663587154">The <term id="term-00180">reverse transcriptase inhibitors</term> block the early step of converting viral RNA genome into DNA, and can include competitive nucleoside analog inhibitors (e.g., <term class="no-emphasis" id="term-00181">azidothymidine/zidovudine</term>, or AZT) and non-nucleoside noncompetitive inhibitors (e.g., <term class="no-emphasis" id="term-00182">etravirine</term>) that bind reverse transcriptase and cause an inactivating conformational change. Drugs called <term id="term-00183">protease inhibitors</term> (e.g., <term class="no-emphasis" id="term-00184">ritonavir</term>) block the processing of viral proteins and prevent viral maturation. Protease inhibitors are also being developed for the treatment of other viral types.<footnote id="fs-id1167663893168">B.L. Pearlman. “Protease Inhibitors for the Treatment of Chronic Hepatitis C Genotype-1 Infection: The New Standard of Care.” <emphasis effect="italics">Lancet Infectious Diseases</emphasis> 12 no. 9 (2012):717–728.</footnote> For example, <term class="no-emphasis" id="term-00185">simeprevir</term> (<term class="no-emphasis" id="term-00186">Olysio</term>) has been approved for the treatment of <term class="no-emphasis" id="term-00187">hepatitis C</term> and is administered with <term class="no-emphasis" id="term-00188">ribavirin</term> and <term class="no-emphasis" id="term-00189">interferon</term> in combination therapy. The <term id="term-00190">integrase inhibitors</term> (e.g., <term class="no-emphasis" id="term-00191">raltegravir</term>), block the activity of the HIV integrase responsible for the recombination of a DNA copy of the viral genome into the host cell chromosome. Additional drug classes for HIV treatment include the CCR5 antagonists and the <term id="term-00192">fusion inhibitors</term> (e.g., <term class="no-emphasis" id="term-00193">enfuviritide</term>), which prevent the binding of HIV to the host cell coreceptor (chemokine receptor type 5 [CCR5]) and the merging of the viral envelope with the host cell membrane, respectively. <link target-id="fs-id1167661791415"/> shows the various therapeutic classes of antiviral drugs, categorized by mode of action, with examples of each.</para>

<list id="fs-id1167661433781" list-type="bulleted" bullet-style="bullet">
<item>Because fungi, protozoans, and helminths are eukaryotic organisms like human cells, it is more challenging to develop antimicrobial drugs that specifically target them. Similarly, it is hard to target viruses because human viruses replicate inside of human cells.</item>
<item><emphasis effect="bold">Antifungal drugs</emphasis> interfere with ergosterol synthesis, bind to ergosterol to disrupt fungal cell membrane integrity, or target cell wall-specific components or other cellular proteins.</item>
<item><emphasis effect="bold">Antiprotozoan drugs</emphasis> increase cellular levels of reactive oxygen species, interfere with protozoal DNA replication (nuclear versus kDNA, respectively), and disrupt heme detoxification.</item>
<item><emphasis effect="bold">Antihelminthic drugs</emphasis> disrupt helminthic and protozoan microtubule formation; block neuronal transmissions; inhibit anaerobic ATP formation and/or oxidative phosphorylation; induce a calcium influx in tapeworms, leading to spasms and paralysis; and interfere with RNA synthesis in schistosomes.</item>
<item><emphasis effect="bold">Antiviral drugs</emphasis> inhibit viral entry, inhibit viral uncoating, inhibit nucleic acid biosynthesis, prevent viral escape from endosomes in host cells, and prevent viral release from infected cells.</item>
<item>Because it can easily mutate to become drug resistant, HIV is typically treated with a combination of several <emphasis effect="bold">antiretroviral drugs</emphasis>, which may include <emphasis effect="bold">reverse transcriptase inhibitors, protease inhibitors, integrase inhibitors</emphasis>, and drugs that interfere with viral binding and fusion to initiate infection.</item>
