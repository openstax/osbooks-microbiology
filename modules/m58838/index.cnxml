<para id="fs-id1172098618979">Thus far, we have discussed the structure and function of individual pieces of <term class="no-emphasis" id="term-00001">DNA</term> and <term class="no-emphasis" id="term-00002">RNA</term>. In this section, we will discuss how all of an organism’s genetic material—collectively referred to as its <term id="term-00003">genome</term>—is organized inside of the cell. Since an organism’s <term class="no-emphasis" id="term-00004">genetics</term> to a large extent dictate its characteristics, it should not be surprising that organisms differ in the arrangement of their DNA and RNA.</para>

<title>Genotype versus Phenotype</title>
<para id="fs-id1172100906080">All cellular activities are encoded within a cell’s DNA. The sequence of bases within a DNA molecule represents the genetic information of the cell. Segments of DNA molecules are called <term id="term-00005">gene</term>s, and individual genes contain the instructional code necessary for synthesizing various proteins, enzymes, or stable RNA molecules.</para>
<para id="fs-id1172100936282">The full collection of genes that a cell contains within its genome is called its <term id="term-00006">genotype</term>. However, a cell does not express all of its genes simultaneously. Instead, it turns on (expresses) or turns off certain genes when necessary. The set of genes being expressed at any given point in time determines the cell’s activities and its observable characteristics, referred to as its <term id="term-00007">phenotype</term>. Genes that are always expressed are known as <term class="no-emphasis" id="term-00008">constitutive genes</term>; some constitutive genes are known as <term class="no-emphasis" id="term-00009">housekeeping genes</term> because they are necessary for the basic functions of the cell.</para>
<para id="fs-id1172098294896">While the genotype of a cell remains constant, the phenotype may change in response to environmental signals (e.g., changes in temperature or nutrient availability) that affect which nonconstitutive genes are expressed. For example, the oral bacterium <term class="no-emphasis" id="term-00010"><emphasis effect="italics">Streptococcus mutans</emphasis></term> produces a sticky slime layer that allows it to adhere to teeth, forming <term class="no-emphasis" id="term-00011">dental plaque</term>; however, the genes that control the production of the slime layer are only expressed in the presence of sucrose (table sugar). Thus, while the genotype of <emphasis effect="italics">S. mutans</emphasis> is constant, its phenotype changes depending on the presence and absence of sugar in its environment. Temperature can also regulate <term class="no-emphasis" id="term-00012">gene expression</term>. For example, the gram-negative bacterium <term class="no-emphasis" id="term-00013"><emphasis effect="italics">Serratia marcescens</emphasis></term>, a pathogen frequently associated with hospital-acquired infections, produces a red pigment at 28 °C but not at 37 °C, the normal internal temperature of the human body (<link target-id="OSC_Microbio_10_04_GenoPheno"/>).</para>

<title>Organization of Genetic Material</title>
<para id="fs-id1172100803036">The vast majority of an organism’s genome is organized into the cell’s <term id="term-00014">chromosomes</term>, which are discrete DNA structures within cells that control cellular activity. Recall that while eukaryotic chromosomes are housed in the membrane-bound nucleus, most prokaryotes contain a single, circular chromosome that is found in an area of the cytoplasm called the <term class="no-emphasis" id="term-00015">nucleoid</term> (see <link document="m58792">Unique Characteristics of Prokaryotic Cells</link>). A chromosome may contain several thousand genes.</para>
<section id="fs-id1172096503520">
<title>Organization of Eukaryotic Chromosome</title>
<para id="fs-id1172098544851">Chromosome structure differs somewhat between eukaryotic and prokaryotic cells. Eukaryotic chromosomes are typically linear, and eukaryotic cells contain multiple distinct chromosomes. Many eukaryotic cells contain two copies of each chromosome and, therefore, are <term id="term-00016">diploid</term>.</para>
<para id="fs-id1172100716541">The length of a chromosome greatly exceeds the length of the cell, so a chromosome needs to be packaged into a very small space to fit within the cell. For example, the combined length of all of the 3 billion base pairs<footnote id="fs-id1172100991657">National Human Genome Research Institute. “The Human Genome Project Completion: Frequently Asked Questions.” https://www.genome.gov/11006943. Accessed June 10, 2016</footnote> of DNA of the human genome would measure approximately 2 meters if completely stretched out, and some eukaryotic genomes are many times larger than the human genome. DNA <term id="term-00017">supercoiling</term> refers to the process by which DNA is twisted to fit inside the cell. Supercoiling may result in DNA that is either underwound (less than one turn of the helix per 10 base pairs) or overwound (more than one turn per 10 base pairs) from its normal relaxed state. Proteins known to be involved in supercoiling include <term id="term-00018">topoisomerases</term>; these enzymes help maintain the structure of supercoiled chromosomes, preventing overwinding of DNA during certain cellular processes like DNA replication.</para>
<para id="fs-id1172098282870">During <term id="term-00019">DNA packaging</term>, DNA-binding proteins called <term id="term-00020">histones</term> perform various levels of DNA wrapping and attachment to scaffolding proteins. The combination of DNA with these attached proteins is referred to as <term id="term-00021">chromatin</term>. In eukaryotes, the packaging of DNA by histones may be influenced by environmental factors that affect the presence of methyl groups on certain cytosine nucleotides of DNA. The influence of environmental factors on DNA packaging is called <term class="no-emphasis" id="term-00022">epigenetics</term>. Epigenetics is another mechanism for regulating gene expression without altering the sequence of nucleotides. Epigenetic changes can be maintained through multiple rounds of cell division and, therefore, can be heritable.</para>

<title>Organization of Prokaryotic Chromosomes</title>
<para id="fs-id1172096288329">Chromosomes in bacteria and archaea are usually circular, and a prokaryotic cell typically contains only a single chromosome within the <term class="no-emphasis" id="term-00023">nucleoid</term>. Because the chromosome contains only one copy of each gene, prokaryotes are <term id="term-00024">haploid</term>. As in eukaryotic cells, DNA <term class="no-emphasis" id="term-00025">supercoiling</term> is necessary for the genome to fit within the prokaryotic cell. The DNA in the bacterial chromosome is arranged in several supercoiled domains. As with eukaryotes, topoisomerases are involved in supercoiling DNA. <term class="no-emphasis" id="term-00026">DNA gyrase</term> is a type of topoisomerase, found in bacteria and some archaea, that helps prevent the overwinding of DNA. (Some antibiotics kill bacteria by targeting DNA gyrase.) In addition, <term class="no-emphasis" id="term-00027">histone-like proteins</term> bind DNA and aid in DNA packaging. Other proteins bind to the origin of replication, the location in the chromosome where DNA replication initiates. Because different regions of DNA are packaged differently, some regions of chromosomal DNA are more accessible to enzymes and thus may be used more readily as templates for gene expression. Interestingly, several bacteria, including <term class="no-emphasis" id="term-00028"><emphasis effect="italics">Helicobacter pylori</emphasis></term> and <term class="no-emphasis" id="term-00029"><emphasis effect="italics">Shigella flexneri</emphasis></term>, have been shown to induce epigenetic changes in their hosts upon infection, leading to <term class="no-emphasis" id="term-00030">chromatin remodeling</term> that may cause long-term effects on host immunity.<footnote id="fs-id1172098644955">H.

<title>Extrachromosomal DNA</title>
<para id="fs-id1172098499472">Although most DNA is contained within a cell’s chromosomes, many cells have additional molecules of DNA outside the chromosomes, called <term id="term-00036">extrachromosomal DNA</term>, that are also part of its genome. The genomes of eukaryotic cells would also include the chromosomes from any organelles such as mitochondria and/or chloroplasts that these cells maintain (<link target-id="OSC_Microbio_10_04_Extrachrom"/>). The maintenance of circular chromosomes in these organelles is a vestige of their prokaryotic origins and supports the <term class="no-emphasis" id="term-00037">endosymbiotic theory</term> (see <link document="m58791">Foundations of Modern Cell Theory</link>). In some cases, genomes of certain DNA viruses can also be maintained independently in host cells during latent viral infection. In these cases, these viruses are another form of extrachromosomal DNA. For example, the human papillomavirus (HPV) may be maintained in infected cells in this way.</para>

Bacteria can exchange these plasmids with other bacteria in a process known as <term class="no-emphasis" id="term-00039">horizontal gene transfer <emphasis effect="bold">(</emphasis>HGT)</term>. The exchange of genetic material on plasmids sometimes provides microbes with new genes beneficial for growth and survival under special conditions.

<para id="fs-id1172100836492">Maria, a 20-year-old anthropology student from Texas, recently became ill in the African nation of Botswana, where she was conducting research as part of a study-abroad program. Maria’s research was focused on traditional African methods of tanning hides for the production of leather. Over a period of three weeks, she visited a tannery daily for several hours to observe and participate in the tanning process. One day, after returning from the tannery, Maria developed a fever, chills, and a headache, along with chest pain, muscle aches, nausea, and other flu-like symptoms. Initially, she was not concerned, but when her fever spiked and she began to cough up blood, her African host family became alarmed and rushed her to the hospital, where her condition continued to worsen.</para>
<para id="fs-id1172100786316">After learning about her recent work at the tannery, the physician suspected that Maria had been exposed to <term class="no-emphasis" id="term-00040">anthrax</term>. He ordered a chest X-ray, a blood sample, and a spinal tap, and immediately started her on a course of intravenous penicillin. Unfortunately, lab tests confirmed the physician’s presumptive diagnosis. Maria’s chest X-ray exhibited pleural effusion, the accumulation of fluid in the space between the pleural membranes, and a Gram stain of her blood revealed the presence of gram-positive, rod-shaped bacteria in short chains, consistent with <term class="no-emphasis" id="term-00041"><emphasis effect="italics">Bacillus anthracis</emphasis></term>. Blood and bacteria were also shown to be present in her cerebrospinal fluid, indicating that the infection had progressed to meningitis. Despite supportive treatment and aggressive antibiotic therapy, Maria slipped into an unresponsive state and died three days later.</para>
<para id="fs-id1172098544777">Anthrax is a disease caused by the introduction of endospores from the gram-positive bacterium <emphasis effect="italics">B. anthracis</emphasis> into the body.

Since <emphasis effect="italics">B. cereus</emphasis> lacks these plasmids, it does not produce these virulence factors, and although it is still pathogenic, it is typically associated with mild cases of diarrhea from which the body can quickly recover.

<title>Genome Size Matters</title>
<para id="fs-id1172096092071">There is great variation in size of genomes among different organisms. Most eukaryotes maintain multiple chromosomes; humans, for example have 23 pairs, giving them 46 chromosomes. Despite being large at 3 billion base pairs, the human genome is far from the largest genome. Plants often maintain very large genomes, up to 150 billion base pairs, and commonly are polyploid, having multiple copies of each chromosome.</para>
<para id="fs-id1172100724061">The size of <term class="no-emphasis" id="term-00057">bacterial genomes</term> also varies considerably, although they tend to be smaller than eukaryotic genomes (<link target-id="OSC_Microbio_10_04_GenomeSize"/>). Some bacterial genomes may be as small as only 112,000 base pairs. Often, the size of a bacterium’s genome directly relates to how much the bacterium depends on its host for survival. When a bacterium relies on the host cell to carry out certain functions, it loses the genes encoding the abilities to carry out those functions itself. These types of bacterial endosymbionts are reminiscent of the prokaryotic origins of mitochondria and chloroplasts.</para>
<para id="fs-id1172100993904">From a clinical perspective, obligate and facultative intracellular pathogens also tend to have small genomes (some around 1 million base pairs). Because host cells can supply most of their nutrients, they tend to have a reduced number of genes encoding metabolic functions, making their cultivation in the laboratory difficult if not impossible Due to their small sizes, the genomes of organisms like <term class="no-emphasis" id="term-00058"><emphasis effect="italics">Mycoplasma genitalium</emphasis></term> (580,000 base pairs), <term class="no-emphasis" id="term-00059"><emphasis effect="italics">Chlamydia trachomatis</emphasis></term> (1.0 million), <term class="no-emphasis" id="term-00060"><emphasis effect="italics">Rickettsia prowazekii</emphasis></term> (1.1 million), and <term class="no-emphasis" id="term-00061"><emphasis effect="italics">Treponema pallidum</emphasis></term> (1.1 million) were some of the earlier bacterial genomes sequenced. Respectively, these pathogens cause urethritis and pelvic inflammation, chlamydia, typhus, and syphilis.</para>
<para id="fs-id1172100572534">Whereas obligate intracellular pathogens have unusually small genomes, other bacteria with a great variety of metabolic and enzymatic capabilities have unusually large bacterial genomes. <emphasis effect="italics">Pseudomonas aeruginosa</emphasis>, for example, is a bacterium commonly found in the environment and is able to grow on a wide range of substrates. Its genome contains 6.3 million base pairs, giving it a high metabolic ability and the ability to produce virulence factors that cause several types of opportunistic infections<emphasis effect="italics">.</emphasis></para>
<para id="fs-id1172098750149">Interestingly, there has been significant variability in genome size in viruses as well, ranging from 3,500 base pairs to 2.5 million base pairs, significantly exceeding the size of many bacterial genomes. The great variation observed in viral genome sizes further contributes to the great diversity of viral genome characteristics already discussed.</para>

Fungi have genomes that range from 10 to the 6th to 10 to the 8th bp. Saccharomyces cerevisiae (yeast) has a genome of 1.2 x 10 to the 7th bp. Plants and animals have genomes that range from 10 to the 6th to 10 to the 11th bp. Mammals range from 10 to the 9th to 10 to the 10th bp. Humans have a genome of 3 x 10 to the 9th.">

<title>Key Concepts and Summary</title>
<list id="fs-id1172100577971" list-type="bulleted" bullet-style="bullet">
<item>The entire genetic content of a cell is its <emphasis effect="bold">genome</emphasis>.</item>
<item><emphasis effect="bold">Genes</emphasis> code for proteins, or stable RNA molecules, each of which carries out a specific function in the cell.</item>
<item>Although the <emphasis effect="bold">genotype</emphasis> that a cell possesses remains constant, expression of genes is dependent on environmental conditions.</item>
<item>A <emphasis effect="bold">phenotype</emphasis> is the observable characteristics of a cell (or organism) at a given point in time and results from the complement of genes currently being used.</item>
<item>The majority of genetic material is organized into <emphasis effect="bold">chromosomes</emphasis> that contain the DNA that controls cellular activities.</item>
<item>Prokaryotes are typically haploid, usually having a single circular chromosome found in the nucleoid. Eukaryotes are diploid; DNA is organized into multiple linear chromosomes found in the nucleus.</item>
<item>Supercoiling and DNA packaging using DNA binding proteins allows lengthy molecules to fit inside a cell. Eukaryotes and archaea use histone proteins, and bacteria use different proteins with similar function.</item>
<item>Prokaryotic and eukaryotic genomes both contain <emphasis effect="bold">noncoding DNA</emphasis>, the function of which is not well understood. Some noncoding DNA appears to participate in the formation of small noncoding RNA molecules that influence gene expression; some appears to play a role in maintaining chromosomal structure and in DNA packaging.</item>
<item><emphasis effect="bold">Extrachromosomal DNA</emphasis> in eukaryotes includes the chromosomes found within organelles of prokaryotic origin (mitochondria and chloroplasts) that evolved by endosymbiosis. Some viruses may also maintain themselves extrachromosomally.</item>
<item>Extrachromosomal DNA in prokaryotes is commonly maintained as <emphasis effect="bold">plasmids</emphasis> that encode a few nonessential genes that may be helpful under specific conditions. Plasmids can be spread through a bacterial community by horizontal gene transfer.</item>
<item>Viral genomes show extensive variation and may be composed of either RNA or DNA, and may be either double or single stranded.</item>
