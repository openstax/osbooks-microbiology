<para id="fs-id1167663737351">The most abundant biomolecules on earth are <term id="term-00001">carbohydrate</term><emphasis effect="bold">s</emphasis>. From a chemical viewpoint, carbohydrates are primarily a combination of carbon and water, and many of them have the empirical formula (CH<sub>2</sub>O)<sub>n</sub>, where <emphasis effect="italics">n</emphasis> is the number of repeated units. This view represents these molecules simply as “hydrated” carbon atom chains in which water molecules attach to each carbon atom, leading to the term “carbohydrates.” Although all carbohydrates contain carbon, hydrogen, and oxygen, there are some that also contain nitrogen, phosphorus, and/or sulfur. Carbohydrates have myriad different functions. They are abundant in terrestrial ecosystems, many forms of which we use as food sources. These molecules are also vital parts of macromolecular structures that store and transmit genetic information (i.e., DNA and RNA). They are the basis of biological polymers that impart strength to various structural components of organisms (e.g., cellulose and chitin), and they are the primary source of energy storage in the form of starch and glycogen.</para>

<title>Monosaccharides: The Sweet Ones</title>
<para id="fs-id1167663728456">In biochemistry, carbohydrates are often called <term id="term-00002">saccharide</term><emphasis effect="bold">s</emphasis>, from the Greek <emphasis effect="italics">sakcharon</emphasis>, meaning sugar, although not all the saccharides are sweet. The simplest carbohydrates are called <term id="term-00003">monosaccharide</term><emphasis effect="bold">s</emphasis>, or simple sugars. They are the building blocks (monomers) for the synthesis of polymers or complex carbohydrates, as will be discussed further in this section. Monosaccharides are classified based on the number of carbons in the molecule. General categories are identified using a prefix that indicates the number of carbons and the suffix –<emphasis effect="italics">ose</emphasis>, which indicates a saccharide; for example, triose (three carbons), tetrose (four carbons), pentose (five carbons), and hexose (six carbons) (<link target-id="OSC_Microbio_07_02_monosacch"/>). The hexose D-glucose is the most abundant monosaccharide in nature. Other very common and abundant hexose monosaccharides are <term class="no-emphasis" id="term-00004">galactose</term>, used to make the disaccharide milk sugar <term class="no-emphasis" id="term-00005">lactose</term>, and the fruit sugar <term class="no-emphasis" id="term-00006">fructose</term>.</para>

Dihydroxyacetone is a ketose because it has a double bonded O attached in the center of the chain. Glyceraldehyde is a triose because it has 3 carbons. Ribose is a pentose because it has 5 carbons. Glucose is a hexose because it has 6 carbons.">

</figure>
<para id="fs-id1167663737853">Monosaccharides of four or more carbon atoms are typically more stable when they adopt cyclic, or ring, structures. These ring structures result from a chemical reaction between functional groups on opposite ends of the sugar’s flexible carbon chain, namely the carbonyl group and a relatively distant hydroxyl group. Glucose, for example, forms a six-membered ring (<link target-id="OSC_Microbio_07_02_cyclicMon"/>).</para>

<title>Polysaccharides</title>
<para id="fs-id1167663731408">Polysaccharides, also called <term class="no-emphasis" id="term-00016">glycans</term>, are large polymers composed of hundreds of monosaccharide monomers. Unlike mono- and disaccharides, <term id="term-00017">polysaccharides</term> are not sweet and, in general, they are not soluble in water. Like disaccharides, the monomeric units of polysaccharides are linked together by <term class="no-emphasis" id="term-00018">glycosidic bond</term>s.</para>
<para id="fs-id1167663602935">Polysaccharides are very diverse in their structure. Three of the most biologically important polysaccharides—<term id="term-00019">starch</term>, <term id="term-00020">glycogen</term>, and <term id="term-00021">cellulose</term>—are all composed of repetitive glucose units, although they differ in their structure (<link target-id="OSC_Microbio_07_02_polysacch"/>). Cellulose consists of a linear chain of glucose molecules and is a common structural component of cell walls in plants and other organisms. Glycogen and starch are branched polymers; glycogen is the primary energy-storage molecule in animals and bacteria, whereas plants primarily store energy in starch. The orientation of the <term class="no-emphasis" id="term-00022">glycosidic linkage</term>s in these three polymers is different as well and, as a consequence, linear and branched macromolecules have different properties.</para>
