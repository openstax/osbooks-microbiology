<para id="fs-id1167662700062">A wide range of gastrointestinal diseases are caused by bacterial contamination of food. Recall that <term id="term-00001">foodborne disease</term> can arise from either <term class="no-emphasis" id="term-00002">infection</term> or <term class="no-emphasis" id="term-00003">intoxication</term>. In both cases, bacterial toxins are typically responsible for producing disease signs and symptoms. The distinction lies in where the toxins are produced. In an infection, the microbial agent is ingested, colonizes the gut, and then produces toxins that damage host cells. In an intoxication, bacteria produce toxins in the food before it is ingested. In either case, the toxins cause damage to the cells lining the gastrointestinal tract, typically the colon. This leads to the common signs and symptoms of diarrhea or watery stool and abdominal cramps, or the more severe <term class="no-emphasis" id="term-00004">dysentery</term>. Symptoms of foodborne diseases also often include nausea and vomiting, which are mechanisms the body uses to expel the toxic materials.</para>
<para id="fs-id1167662469218">Most bacterial gastrointestinal illness is short-lived and self-limiting; however, loss of fluids due to severe diarrheal illness can lead to dehydration that can, in some cases, be fatal without proper treatment. Oral rehydration therapy with electrolyte solutions is an essential aspect of treatment for most patients with GI disease, especially in children and infants.</para>

<title>Staphylococcal Food Poisoning</title>
<para id="fs-id1167662497593"><term id="term-00005">Staphylococcal food poisoning</term> is one form of food intoxication. When <term class="no-emphasis" id="term-00006"><emphasis effect="italics">Staphylococcus aureus</emphasis></term> grows in food, it may produce <term class="no-emphasis" id="term-00007">enterotoxins</term> that, when ingested, can cause symptoms such as nausea, diarrhea, cramping, and vomiting within one to six hours. In some severe cases, it may cause headache, dehydration, and changes in blood pressure and heart rate. Signs and symptoms resolve within 24 to 48 hours. <emphasis effect="italics">S. aureus</emphasis> is often associated with a variety of raw or undercooked and cooked foods including meat (e.g., canned meat, ham, and sausages) and dairy products (e.g., cheeses, milk, and butter). It is also commonly found on hands and can be transmitted to prepared foods through poor hygiene, including poor handwashing and the use of contaminated food preparation surfaces, such as cutting boards. The greatest risk is for food left at a temperature below 60 °C (140 °F), which allows the bacteria to grow. Cooked foods should generally be reheated to at least 60 °C (140 °F) for safety and most raw meats should be cooked to even higher internal temperatures (<link target-id="OSC_Microbio_24_03_DangerZone"/>).</para>

<para id="fs-id1167662450422">There are at least 21 <emphasis effect="italics">Staphylococcal</emphasis> enterotoxins and <emphasis effect="italics">Staphylococcal</emphasis> enterotoxin-like toxins that can cause food intoxication. The enterotoxins are proteins that are resistant to low pH, allowing them to pass through the stomach. They are heat stable and are not destroyed by boiling at 100 °C. Even though the bacterium itself may be killed, the enterotoxins alone can cause vomiting and diarrhea, although the mechanisms are not fully understood. At least some of the symptoms may be caused by the enterotoxin functioning as a <term class="no-emphasis" id="term-00008">superantigen</term> and provoking a strong immune response by activating T cell proliferation.</para>
<para id="fs-id1167662388923">The rapid onset of signs and symptoms helps to diagnose this <term class="no-emphasis" id="term-00009">foodborne illness</term>.

<title>Shigellosis (Bacillary Dysentery)</title>
<para id="fs-id1167662393343">When gastrointestinal illness is associated with the rod-shaped, gram-negative bacterium <term class="no-emphasis" id="term-00011"><emphasis effect="italics">Shigella</emphasis></term>, it is called <term id="term-00012">bacillary dysentery</term>, or <term id="term-00013">shigellosis</term>. Infections can be caused by <emphasis effect="italics">S. dysenteriae</emphasis>, <emphasis effect="italics">S. flexneri</emphasis>, <emphasis effect="italics">S. boydii</emphasis>, and/or <emphasis effect="italics">S. sonnei</emphasis> that colonize the GI tract. Shigellosis can be spread from hand to mouth or through contaminated food and water. Most commonly, it is transmitted through the fecal-oral route.</para>
<para id="fs-id1167660328050"><emphasis effect="italics">Shigella</emphasis> bacteria invade intestinal epithelial cells. When taken into a phagosome, they can escape and then live within the cytoplasm of the cell or move to adjacent cells. As the organisms multiply, the epithelium and structures with M cells of the <term class="no-emphasis" id="term-00014">Peyer’s patches</term> in the intestine may become ulcerated and cause loss of fluid. Stomach cramps, fever, and watery diarrhea that may also contain pus, <term class="no-emphasis" id="term-00015">mucus</term>, and/or blood often develop. More severe cases may result in ulceration of the mucosa, dehydration, and rectal bleeding. Additionally, patients may later develop <term class="no-emphasis" id="term-00016">hemolytic uremic syndrome (HUS)</term>, a serious condition in which damaged blood cells build up in the kidneys and may cause kidney failure, or <term class="no-emphasis" id="term-00017">reactive arthritis</term>, a condition in which arthritis develops in multiple joints following infection. Patients may also develop chronic post-infection irritable bowel syndrome (IBS).</para>
<para id="fs-id1167662570249"><emphasis effect="italics">S. dysenteriae</emphasis> type 1 is able to produce <term class="no-emphasis" id="term-00018">Shiga toxin</term>, which targets the endothelial cells of small blood vessels in the small and large intestine by binding to a glycosphingolipid. Once inside the endothelial cells, the toxin targets the large ribosomal subunit, thus affecting protein synthesis of these cells. Hemorrhaging and lesions in the colon can result. The toxin can target the kidney’s glomerulus, the blood vessels where filtration of blood in the kidney begins, thus resulting in HUS.</para>
<para id="fs-id1167660283538">Stool samples, which should be processed promptly, are analyzed using serological or molecular techniques. One common method is to perform immunoassays for <emphasis effect="italics">S. dysenteriae.</emphasis> (Other methods that can be used to identify <emphasis effect="italics">Shigella</emphasis> include API test strips, Enterotube systems, or PCR testing.

<para id="fs-id1167662447004"><term class="no-emphasis" id="term-00021"><emphasis effect="italics">Salmonella</emphasis></term> gastroenteritis, also called <term id="term-00022">salmonellosis</term>, is caused by the rod-shaped, gram-negative bacterium <emphasis effect="italics">Salmonella</emphasis>. Two species, <emphasis effect="italics">S. enterica</emphasis> and <emphasis effect="italics">S. bongori</emphasis>, cause disease in humans, but <emphasis effect="italics">S. enterica</emphasis> is the most common. The most common serotypes of <emphasis effect="italics">S. enterica</emphasis> are Enteritidis and <term class="no-emphasis" id="term-00023">Typhi</term>. We will discuss typhoid fever caused by serotypes Typhi and Paratyphi A separately. Here, we will focus on salmonellosis caused by other serotypes.</para>
<para id="fs-id1167662704964"><emphasis effect="italics">Salmonella</emphasis> is a part of the normal intestinal microbiota of many individuals. However, salmonellosis is caused by exogenous agents, and infection can occur depending on the serotype, size of the inoculum, and overall health of the host. Infection is caused by ingestion of contaminated food, handling of eggshells, or exposure to certain animals. <emphasis effect="italics">Salmonella</emphasis> is part of poultry’s microbiota, so exposure to raw eggs and raw poultry can increase the risk of infection. Handwashing and cooking foods thoroughly greatly reduce the risk of transmission. <emphasis effect="italics">Salmonella</emphasis> bacteria can survive freezing for extended periods but cannot survive high temperatures.</para>
<para id="fs-id1167660330509">Once the bacteria are ingested, they multiply within the intestines and penetrate the epithelial mucosal cells via M cells where they continue to grow (<link target-id="OSC_Microbio_24_03_Salmonella"/>). They trigger inflammatory processes and the hypersecretion of fluids. Once inside the body, they can persist inside the phagosomes of macrophages. <emphasis effect="italics">Salmonella</emphasis> can cross the epithelial cell membrane and enter the bloodstream and lymphatic system. Some strains of <emphasis effect="italics">Salmonella</emphasis> also produce an <term class="no-emphasis" id="term-00024">enterotoxin</term> that can cause an <term class="no-emphasis" id="term-00025">intoxication</term>.</para>
<para id="fs-id1167662496605">Infected individuals develop fever, nausea, abdominal cramps, vomiting, headache, and diarrhea. These signs and symptoms generally last a few days to a week.

Updated August 25, 2016. https://www.cdc.gov/salmonella. </footnote> However, because the disease is usually self-limiting, many cases are not reported to doctors and the overall incidence may be underreported. Diagnosis involves culture followed by serotyping and DNA fingerprinting if needed. Positive results are reported to the CDC. When an unusual serotype is detected, samples are sent to the CDC for further analysis. Serotyping is important for determining treatment. Oral rehydration therapy is commonly used. Antibiotics are only recommended for serious cases. When antibiotics are needed, as in immunocompromised patients, <term class="no-emphasis" id="term-00026">fluoroquinolones</term>, third-generation <term class="no-emphasis" id="term-00027">cephalosporins</term>, and <term class="no-emphasis" id="term-00028">ampicillin</term> are recommended.

<title>Typhoid Mary</title>
<para id="fs-id1167662705681">Mary <term class="no-emphasis" id="term-00039">Mallon</term> was an Irish immigrant who worked as a cook in New York in the early 20<sup>th</sup> century. Over seven years, from 1900 to 1907, Mallon worked for a number of different households, unknowingly spreading illness to the people who lived in each one. In 1906, one family hired George Soper, an expert in typhoid fever epidemics, to determine the cause of the illnesses in their household. Eventually, Soper tracked Mallon down and directly linked 22 cases of typhoid fever to her. He discovered that Mallon was a carrier for typhoid but was immune to it herself. Although active carriers had been recognized before, this was the first time that an asymptomatic carrier of infection had been identified.</para>
<para id="fs-id1167660261395">Because she herself had never been ill, Mallon found it difficult to believe she could be the source of the illness. She fled from Soper and the authorities because she did not want to be quarantined or forced to give up her profession, which was relatively well paid for someone with her background. However, Mallon was eventually caught and kept in an isolation facility in the Bronx, where she remained until 1910, when the New York health department released her under the condition that she never again work with food. Unfortunately, Mallon did not comply, and she soon began working as a cook again. After new cases began to appear that resulted in the death of two individuals, the authorities tracked her down again and returned her to isolation, where she remained for 23 more years until her death in 1938. Epidemiologists were able to trace 51 cases of typhoid fever and three deaths directly to Mallon, who is unflatteringly remembered as “<term class="no-emphasis" id="term-00040">Typhoid Mary</term>.”</para>
<para id="fs-id1167662550637">The Typhoid Mary case has direct correlations in the health-care industry. Consider Kaci Hickox, an American nurse who treated Ebola patients in West Africa during the 2014 epidemic. After returning to the United States, Hickox was quarantined against her will for three days and later found not to have Ebola. Hickox vehemently opposed the quarantine. In an editorial published in the British newspaper <emphasis effect="italics">The Guardian</emphasis>,<footnote id="fs-id1167662509159">Kaci Hickox. “Stop Calling Me the ‘Ebola Nurse.’” <emphasis effect="italics">The Guardian.</emphasis> November 17, 2014. http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2014/nov/17/stop-calling-me-ebola-nurse-kaci-hickox.</footnote> Hickox argued that quarantining asymptomatic health-care workers who had not tested positive for a disease would not only prevent such individuals from practicing their profession, but discourage others from volunteering to work in disease-ridden areas where health-care workers are desperately needed.</para>
<para id="fs-id1167660172797">What is the responsibility of an individual like Mary Mallon to change her behavior to protect others? What happens when an individual believes that she is not a risk, but others believe that she is? How would you react if you were in Mallon’s shoes and were placed in a quarantine you did not believe was necessary, at the expense of your own freedom and possibly your career? Would it matter if you were definitely infected or not?</para>

<title><emphasis effect="italics">E. coli</emphasis> Infections</title>
<para id="fs-id1167660151054">The gram-negative rod <term class="no-emphasis" id="term-00041"><emphasis effect="italics">Escherichia coli</emphasis></term> is a common member of the normal microbiota of the colon. Although the vast majority of <emphasis effect="italics">E. coli</emphasis> strains are helpful commensal bacteria, some can be pathogenic and may cause dangerous diarrheal disease. The pathogenic strains have additional virulence factors such as type 1 <term class="no-emphasis" id="term-00042">fimbriae</term> that promote colonization of the colon or may produce toxins (see <link document="m58868">Virulence Factors of Bacterial and Viral Pathogens</link>). These virulence factors are acquired through <term class="no-emphasis" id="term-00043">horizontal gene transfer</term>.</para>
<para id="fs-id1167662384380">Extraintestinal disease can result if the bacteria spread from the gastrointestinal tract. Although these bacteria can be spread from person to person, they are often acquired through contaminated food or water. There are six recognized pathogenic groups of <emphasis effect="italics">E. coli</emphasis>, but we will focus here on the four that are most commonly transmitted through food and water.</para>
<para id="fs-id1167660147523"><term id="term-00044">Enterotoxigenic <emphasis effect="italics">E. coli</emphasis> (ETEC)</term>, also known as <term id="term-00045">traveler’s diarrhea</term>, causes diarrheal illness and is common in less developed countries. In Mexico, ETEC infection is called Montezuma’s Revenge. Following ingestion of contaminated food or water, infected individuals develop a watery diarrhea, abdominal cramps, <term id="term-00046">malaise</term> (a feeling of being unwell), and a low fever. ETEC produces a heat-stable <term class="no-emphasis" id="term-00047">enterotoxin</term> similar to <term class="no-emphasis" id="term-00048">cholera toxin</term>, and <term class="no-emphasis" id="term-00049">adhesins</term> called <term class="no-emphasis" id="term-00050">colonization factors</term> that help the bacteria to attach to the intestinal wall. Some strains of ETEC also produce heat-labile toxins. The disease is usually relatively mild and self-limiting. Diagnosis involves culturing and PCR. If needed, antibiotic treatment with <term class="no-emphasis" id="term-00051">fluoroquinolones</term>, <term class="no-emphasis" id="term-00052">doxycycline</term>, <term class="no-emphasis" id="term-00053">rifaximin</term>, and <term class="no-emphasis" id="term-00054">trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole</term> (<term class="no-emphasis" id="term-00055">TMP/SMZ</term>) may shorten infection duration. However, antibiotic resistance is a problem.</para>
<para id="fs-id1167662915790"><term id="term-00056">Enteroinvasive <emphasis effect="italics">E. coli</emphasis> (EIEC)</term> is very similar to <term class="no-emphasis" id="term-00057">shigellosis</term>, including its pathogenesis of intracellular invasion into intestinal epithelial tissue. This bacterium carries a large plasmid that is involved in epithelial cell penetration. The illness is usually self-limiting, with symptoms including watery diarrhea, chills, cramps, malaise, fever, and dysentery. Culturing and PCR testing can be used for diagnosis. Antibiotic treatment is not recommended, so supportive therapy is used if needed.</para>
<para id="fs-id1167660182049"><term id="term-00058">Enteropathogenic <emphasis effect="italics">E. coli</emphasis> (EPEC)</term> can cause a potentially fatal diarrhea, especially in infants and those in less developed countries. Fever, vomiting, and diarrhea can lead to severe dehydration. These <emphasis effect="italics">E. coli</emphasis> inject a protein (Tir) that attaches to the surface of the intestinal epithelial cells and triggers rearrangement of host cell actin from <term class="no-emphasis" id="term-00059">microvilli</term> to pedestals. Tir also happens to be the receptor for <term class="no-emphasis" id="term-00060">Intimin</term>, a surface protein produced by EPEC, thereby allowing <emphasis effect="italics">E. coli</emphasis> to “sit” on the pedestal. The genes necessary for this pedestal formation are encoded on the locus for <term class="no-emphasis" id="term-00061">enterocyte effacement</term> (LEE) <term class="no-emphasis" id="term-00062">pathogenicity island</term>. As with ETEC, diagnosis involves culturing and PCR. Treatment is similar to that for ETEC.</para>
<para id="fs-id1167660261001">The most dangerous strains are <term id="term-00063">enterohemorrhagic <emphasis effect="italics">E. coli</emphasis> (EHEC)</term>, which are the strains capable of causing epidemics. In particular, the strain <term class="no-emphasis" id="term-00064">O157:H7</term> has been responsible for several recent outbreaks. Recall that the O and H refer to surface antigens that contribute to pathogenicity and trigger a host immune response (“O” refers to the O-side chain of the <term class="no-emphasis" id="term-00065">lipopolysaccharide</term> and the “H” refers to the <term class="no-emphasis" id="term-00066">flagella</term>). Similar to EPEC, EHEC also forms pedestals. EHEC also produces a Shiga-like toxin. Because the genome of this bacterium has been sequenced, it is known that the <term class="no-emphasis" id="term-00067">Shiga toxin</term> genes were most likely acquired through transduction (horizontal gene transfer). The Shiga toxin genes originated from <term class="no-emphasis" id="term-00068"><emphasis effect="italics">Shigella</emphasis></term> <emphasis effect="italics">dysenteriae</emphasis>. Prophage from a bacteriophage that previously infected <emphasis effect="italics">Shigella</emphasis> integrated into the chromosome of <emphasis effect="italics">E. coli</emphasis>. The Shiga-like toxin is often called verotoxin.</para>
<para id="fs-id1167660187564">EHEC can cause disease ranging from relatively mild to life-threatening. Symptoms include bloody diarrhea with severe cramping, but no fever. Although it is often self-limiting, it can lead to hemorrhagic colitis and profuse bleeding. One possible complication is HUS. Diagnosis involves culture, often using MacConkey with sorbitol agar to differentiate between <emphasis effect="italics">E. coli</emphasis> O157:H7, which does not ferment sorbitol, and other less virulent strains of <emphasis effect="italics">E. coli</emphasis> that can ferment sorbitol.</para>
<para id="fs-id1167662520237">Serological typing or PCR testing also can be used, as well as genetic testing for Shiga toxin. To distinguish EPEC from EHEC, because they both form pedestals on intestinal epithelial cells, it is necessary to test for genes encoding for both the Shiga-like toxin and for the LEE.

<title>Cholera and Other Vibrios</title>
<para id="fs-id1167662369054">The gastrointestinal disease <term id="term-00069">cholera</term> is a serious infection often associated with poor sanitation, especially following natural disasters, because it is spread through contaminated water and food that has not been heated to temperatures high enough to kill the bacteria. It is caused by <term class="no-emphasis" id="term-00070"><emphasis effect="italics">Vibrio cholerae</emphasis></term> serotype O1, a gram-negative, flagellated bacterium in the shape of a curved rod (vibrio). According to the CDC, cholera causes an estimated 3 to 5 million cases and 100,000 deaths each year.<footnote id="fs-id1167660283571">Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. <emphasis effect="italics">Cholera—Vibrio cholerae Infection</emphasis>.

<para id="fs-id1167662573056">Because <emphasis effect="italics">V. cholerae</emphasis> is killed by stomach acid, relatively large doses are needed for a few microbial cells to survive to reach the intestines and cause infection. The motile cells travel through the mucous layer of the intestines, where they attach to epithelial cells and release <term class="no-emphasis" id="term-00071">cholera enterotoxin</term>. The toxin is an A-B toxin with activity through adenylate cyclase (see <link document="m58868">Virulence Factors of Bacterial and Viral Pathogens</link>). Within the intestinal cell, cyclic AMP (cAMP) levels increase, which activates a chloride channel and results in the release of ions into the intestinal lumen. This increase in osmotic pressure in the lumen leads to water also entering the lumen. As the water and electrolytes leave the body, it causes rapid dehydration and electrolyte imbalance. Diarrhea is so profuse that it is often called “rice water stool,” and patients are placed on cots with a hole in them to monitor the fluid loss (<link target-id="OSC_Microbio_24_03_VibrioChol"/>).</para>
<para id="fs-id1167662592690">Cholera is diagnosed by taking a stool sample and culturing for <emphasis effect="italics">Vibrio</emphasis>. The bacteria are oxidase positive and show non-lactose fermentation on MacConkey agar. Gram-negative lactose fermenters will produce red colonies while non-fermenters will produce white/colorless colonies. Gram-positive bacteria will not grow on MacConkey. Lactose fermentation is commonly used for pathogen identification because the normal microbiota generally ferments lactose while pathogens do not. <emphasis effect="italics">V. cholerae</emphasis> may also be cultured on thiosulfate citrate bile salts sucrose (TCBS) agar, a selective and differential media for <emphasis effect="italics">Vibrio</emphasis> spp., which produce a distinct yellow colony.</para>
<para id="fs-id1167662425370">Cholera may be self-limiting and treatment involves rehydration and electrolyte replenishment. Although antibiotics are not typically needed, they can be used for severe or disseminated disease.
