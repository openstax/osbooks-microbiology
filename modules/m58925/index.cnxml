<para id="fs-id1167663534888">Despite the presence of <term class="no-emphasis" id="term-00001">saliva</term> and the mechanical forces of chewing and eating, some microbes thrive in the mouth. These microbes can cause damage to the teeth and can cause infections that have the potential to spread beyond the mouth and sometimes throughout the body.</para>

<title>Dental Caries</title>
<para id="fs-id1167661457076">Cavities of the teeth, known clinically as <term id="term-00002">dental caries</term>, are microbial lesions that cause damage to the teeth. Over time, the lesion can grow through the outer <term class="no-emphasis" id="term-00003">enamel</term> layer to infect the underlying <term class="no-emphasis" id="term-00004">dentin</term> or even the innermost <term class="no-emphasis" id="term-00005">pulp</term>. If dental caries are not treated, the infection can become an <term class="no-emphasis" id="term-00006">abscess</term> that spreads to the deeper tissues of the <term class="no-emphasis" id="term-00007">teeth</term>, near the roots, or to the bloodstream.</para>
<para id="fs-id1167661272269">Tooth decay results from the metabolic activity of microbes that live on the teeth. A layer of proteins and carbohydrates forms when clean teeth come into contact with saliva. Microbes are attracted to this food source and form a <term class="no-emphasis" id="term-00008">biofilm</term> called <term class="no-emphasis" id="term-00009">plaque</term>. The most important cariogenic species in these biofilms is <term class="no-emphasis" id="term-00010"><emphasis effect="italics">Streptococcus mutans</emphasis></term>. When <term class="no-emphasis" id="term-00011">sucrose</term>, a disaccharide sugar from food, is broken down by bacteria in the mouth, <term class="no-emphasis" id="term-00012">glucose</term> and <term class="no-emphasis" id="term-00013">fructose</term> are produced. The glucose is used to make <term class="no-emphasis" id="term-00014">dextran</term>, which is part of the extracellular matrix of the biofilm. Fructose is fermented, producing organic acids such as <term class="no-emphasis" id="term-00015">lactic acid</term>. These acids dissolve the minerals of the tooth, including <term class="no-emphasis" id="term-00016">enamel</term>, even though it is the hardest material in the body. The acids work even more quickly on exposed <term class="no-emphasis" id="term-00017">dentin</term> (<link target-id="OSC_Microbio_24_02_ToothDecay"/>). Over time, the <term class="no-emphasis" id="term-00018">plaque</term> <term class="no-emphasis" id="term-00019">biofilm</term> can become thick and eventually calcify. When a heavy plaque deposit becomes hardened in this way, it is called <term id="term-00020">tartar</term> or <term id="term-00021">dental calculus</term> (<link target-id="OSC_Microbio_24_02_Xray"/>). These substantial plaque biofilms can include a variety of bacterial species, including <term class="no-emphasis" id="term-00022"><emphasis effect="italics">Streptococcus</emphasis></term> and <term class="no-emphasis" id="term-00023"><emphasis effect="italics">Actinomyces</emphasis></term> species.</para>

<para id="fs-id1167663638301">Some tooth decay is visible from the outside, but it is not always possible to see all decay or the extent of the decay. X-ray imaging is used to produce radiographs that can be studied to look for deeper decay and damage to the root or bone (<link target-id="OSC_Microbio_24_02_Xray"/>). If not detected, the decay can reach the pulp or even spread to the bloodstream. Painful abscesses can develop.</para>
<para id="fs-id1167663987594">To prevent tooth decay, prophylactic treatment and good hygiene are important. Regular tooth brushing and flossing physically removes microbes and combats microbial growth and <term class="no-emphasis" id="term-00024">biofilm</term> formation. Toothpaste contains <term class="no-emphasis" id="term-00025">fluoride</term>, which becomes incorporated into the hydroxyapatite of tooth <term class="no-emphasis" id="term-00026">enamel</term>, protecting it against acidity caused by fermentation of mouth microbiota. Fluoride is also bacteriostatic, thus slowing enamel degradation. Antiseptic mouthwashes commonly contain plant-derived <term class="no-emphasis" id="term-00027">phenolics</term> like <term class="no-emphasis" id="term-00028">thymol</term> and <term class="no-emphasis" id="term-00029">eucalyptol</term> and/or heavy metals like <term class="no-emphasis" id="term-00030">zinc chloride</term> (see <link document="m58855">Using Chemicals to Control Microorganisms</link>). Phenolics tend to be stable and persistent on surfaces, and they act through denaturing proteins and disrupting membranes.</para>
<para id="fs-id1167661335835">Regular dental cleanings allow for the detection of decay at early stages and the removal of <term class="no-emphasis" id="term-00031">tartar</term>. They may also help to draw attention to other concerns, such as damage to the enamel from acidic drinks. Reducing sugar consumption may help prevent damage that results from the microbial fermentation of sugars. Additionally, sugarless candies or gum with sugar alcohols (such as <term class="no-emphasis" id="term-00032">xylitol</term>) can reduce the production of acids because these are fermented to nonacidic compounds (although excess consumption may lead to gastrointestinal distress). Fluoride treatment or ingesting fluoridated water strengthens the minerals in teeth and reduces the incidence of <term class="no-emphasis" id="term-00033">dental caries</term>.</para>
<para id="fs-id1167661344414">If <term class="no-emphasis" id="term-00034">caries</term> develop, prompt treatment prevents worsening. Smaller areas of decay can be drilled to remove affected tissue and then filled. If the <term class="no-emphasis" id="term-00035">pulp</term> is affected, then a <term class="no-emphasis" id="term-00036">root canal</term> may be needed to completely remove the infected tissues to avoid continued spread of the infection, which could lead to painful <term class="no-emphasis" id="term-00037">abscesses</term>.</para>

<title>Periodontal Disease</title>
<para id="fs-id1167661351285">In addition to damage to the <term class="no-emphasis" id="term-00038">teeth</term> themselves, the surrounding structures can be affected by microbes. Periodontal disease is the result of infections that lead to inflammation and tissue damage in the structures surrounding the teeth. The progression from mild to severe <term class="no-emphasis" id="term-00039">periodontal disease</term> is generally reversible and preventable with good oral hygiene.</para>
<para id="fs-id1167663585255">Inflammation of the gums that can lead to irritation and bleeding is called <term id="term-00040">gingivitis</term>. When <term class="no-emphasis" id="term-00041">plaque</term> accumulates on the teeth, bacteria colonize the <term class="no-emphasis" id="term-00042">gingival space</term>. As this space becomes increasingly blocked, the environment becomes anaerobic. This allows a wide variety of microbes to colonize, including <term class="no-emphasis" id="term-00043"><emphasis effect="italics">Porphyromonas</emphasis></term>, <term class="no-emphasis" id="term-00044"><emphasis effect="italics">Streptococcus</emphasis></term>, and <term class="no-emphasis" id="term-00045"><emphasis effect="italics">Actinomyces</emphasis></term>.

<para id="fs-id1167661298135">Over time, chronic gingivitis can develop into the more serious condition of <term id="term-00051">periodontitis</term> (<link target-id="OSC_Microbio_24_02_Peridont"/>). When this happens, the gums recede and expose parts of the tooth below the <term class="no-emphasis" id="term-00052">crown</term>. This newly exposed area is relatively unprotected, so bacteria can grow on it and spread underneath the <term class="no-emphasis" id="term-00053">enamel</term> of the crown and cause <term class="no-emphasis" id="term-00054">cavities</term>. Bacteria in the <term class="no-emphasis" id="term-00055">gingival space</term> can also erode the <term class="no-emphasis" id="term-00056">cementum</term>, which helps to hold the <term class="no-emphasis" id="term-00057">teeth</term> in place. If not treated, erosion of cementum can lead to the movement or loss of teeth. The bones of the jaw can even erode if the infection spreads. This condition can be associated with bleeding and halitosis (bad breath). Cleaning and appropriate dental hygiene may be sufficient to treat periodontitis. However, in cases of severe periodontitis, an antibiotic may be given. Antibiotics may be given in pill form or applied directly to the gum (local treatment). Antibiotics given can include <term class="no-emphasis" id="term-00058">tetracycline</term>, <term class="no-emphasis" id="term-00059">doxycycline</term>, <term class="no-emphasis" id="term-00060">macrolides</term> or <term class="no-emphasis" id="term-00061">β-lactams</term>.

<title>Healthy Mouth, Healthy Body</title>
<para id="fs-id1167663970019">Good oral health promotes good overall health, and the reverse is also true. Poor oral health can lead to difficulty eating, which can cause malnutrition. Painful or loose teeth can also cause a person to avoid certain foods or eat less. Malnutrition due to dental problems is of greatest concern for the elderly, for whom it can worsen other health conditions and contribute to mortality. Individuals who have serious illnesses, especially AIDS, are also at increased risk of malnutrition from dental problems.</para>
<para id="fs-id1167663970022">Additionally, poor oral health can contribute to the development of disease. Increased bacterial growth in the mouth can cause inflammation and infection in other parts of the body. For example, <term class="no-emphasis" id="term-00068"><emphasis effect="italics">Streptococcus</emphasis></term> in the mouth, the main contributor to biofilms on teeth, tartar, and dental caries, can spread throughout the body when there is damage to the tissues inside the mouth, as can happen during dental work. <emphasis effect="italics">S. mutans</emphasis> produces a surface adhesin known as P1, which binds to salivary agglutinin on the surface of the tooth. P1 can also bind to extracellular matrix proteins including fibronectin and collagen. When <emphasis effect="italics">Streptococcus</emphasis> enters the bloodstream as a result of tooth brushing or dental cleaning, it causes inflammation that can lead to the accumulation of plaque in the arteries and contribute to the development of <term class="no-emphasis" id="term-00069">atherosclerosis</term>, a condition associated with cardiovascular disease, heart attack, and stroke.

The causative agent is mumps virus (MuV), a <term class="no-emphasis" id="term-00087">paramyxovirus</term> with an envelope that has hemagglutinin and neuraminidase spikes. A fusion protein located on the surface of the envelope helps to fuse the viral envelope to the host cell plasma membrane.</para>
<para id="fs-id1167663905798">Mumps virus is transmitted through respiratory droplets or through contact with contaminated saliva, making it quite contagious so that it can lead easily to epidemics. It causes fever, muscle pain, headache, pain with chewing, loss of appetite, fatigue, and weakness. There is swelling of the salivary glands and associated pain (<link target-id="OSC_Microbio_24_02_Mumps"/>). The virus can enter the bloodstream (<term class="no-emphasis" id="term-00088">viremia</term>), allowing it to spread to the organs and the central nervous system. The infection ranges from subclinical cases to cases with serious complications, such as <term class="no-emphasis" id="term-00089">encephalitis</term>, <term class="no-emphasis" id="term-00090">meningitis</term>, and deafness.

<para id="fs-id1167661352514">Mumps can be recognized based on clinical signs and symptoms, and a diagnosis can be confirmed with laboratory testing. The virus can be identified using culture or molecular techniques such as RT-PCR. Serologic tests are also available, especially enzyme immunoassays that detect antibodies. There is no specific treatment for mumps, so supportive therapies are used. The most effective way to avoid infection is through vaccination.

<title>Oral Infections</title>
<para id="fs-id1167663656997">Infections of the mouth and oral cavity can be caused by a variety of pathogens, including bacteria, viruses, and fungi. Many of these infections only affect the mouth, but some can spread and become systemic infections. <link target-id="OSC_Microbio_24_02_OralInfTbl"/> summarizes the main characteristics of common oral infections.</para>

<media id="fs-id1167661291390" alt="Table titled: Oral Infections. Columns: Disease, Pathogen, Signs and Symptoms, Transmission, Diagnostic Tests, Antimicrobial Drugs. Dental caries; Streptococcus mutans; Discoloration, softening, cavities in teeth; Non-transmissible; caused by bacteria of the normal oral microbiota; Visual examinations, X-rays Oral antiseptics (e.g., Listerine). Gingivitis and periodontitis; Porphyromonas, Streptococcus, Actinomyces; Inflammation and erosion of gums, bleeding, halitosis; erosion of cementum leading to tooth loss in advanced infections; Non-transmissible; caused by bacteria of the normal oral microbiota; Visual examination, X-rays, measuring pockets in gums; Tetracycline, doxycycline, macrolides or beta-lactams. Mixture of antibiotics may be given. Herpetic gingivostomatitis; Herpes simplex virus type 1 (HSV-1); Lesions in mucous membranes of mouth Contact with saliva or lesions of an infected person Culture or biopsy; Acyclovir, famcyclovir, valacyclovir. Mumps; Mumps virus (a paramyxovirus); Swelling of parotid glands, fever, headache, muscle pain, weakness, fatigue, loss of appetite, pain while chewing; in serious cases, encephalitis, meningitis, and inflammation of testes, ovaries, and breasts; Contact with saliva or respiratory droplets of an infected person; Virus culture or serologic tests for antibodies, enzyme immunoassay, RT-PCR; None for treatment; MMR vaccine for prevention. Oral thrush; Candida albicans, other Candida spp.;  White patches and pseudomembranes in mouth, may cause bleeding; Nontransmissible; caused by overgrowth of Candida spp. in the normal oral microbiota; primarily affects infants and the immunocompromised. Microscopic analysis of oral samples; Clotrimazole, nystatin, fluconazole, or itraconazole; amphotericin B in severe cases. Trench mouth (acute necrotizing ulcerative gingivitis); Prevotella intermedia Fusobacterium species, Treponema vincentii, others; Erosion of gums, ulcers, substantial pain with chewing, halitosis; Nontransmissible; caused by members of the normal oral microbiota; Visual examinations, X-rays; Amoxicillin, amoxicillin clavulanate, clindamycin, or doxycycline.">
