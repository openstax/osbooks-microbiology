<para id="fs-id1167661334161">Similar to streptococcal infections of the skin, the mucosal membranes of the pharynx are damaged by the release of a variety of exoenzymes and exotoxins by this extracellular pathogen. Many strains of <emphasis effect="italics">S. pyogenes</emphasis> can degrade connective tissues by using <term class="no-emphasis" id="term-00005">hyaluronidase</term>, <term class="no-emphasis" id="term-00006">collagenase</term> and <term class="no-emphasis" id="term-00007">streptokinase</term>. Streptokinase activates plasmin, which leads to degradation of fibrin and, in turn, dissolution of blood clots, which assists in the spread of the pathogen. Released toxins include <term class="no-emphasis" id="term-00008">streptolysin</term>s that can destroy red and white blood cells. The classic signs of streptococcal pharyngitis are a fever higher than 38 °C (100.4 °F); intense pharyngeal pain; erythema associated with pharyngeal inflammation; and swollen, dark-red palatine tonsils, often dotted with patches of pus; and petechiae (microcapillary hemorrhages) on the soft or hard palate (roof of the mouth) (<link target-id="OSC_Microbio_22_02_StrepThroa"/>). The submandibular lymph nodes beneath the angle of the jaw are also often swollen during strep throat.</para>
<para id="fs-id1167663993139">Some strains of <term class="no-emphasis" id="term-00009">group A streptococci</term> produce <term id="term-00010">erythrogenic toxin</term>. This exotoxin is encoded by a temperate bacteriophage (bacterial virus) and is an example of <term class="no-emphasis" id="term-00011">phage conversion</term> (see <link document="m58809">The Viral Life Cycle</link>). The toxin attacks the plasma membranes of capillary endothelial cells and leads to <term id="term-00012">scarlet fever</term> (or scarlatina), a disseminated fine red rash on the skin, and <term class="no-emphasis" id="term-00013">strawberry tongue</term>, a red rash on the tongue (<link target-id="OSC_Microbio_22_02_StrepThroa"/>). Severe cases may even lead to <term class="no-emphasis" id="term-00014">streptococcal toxic shock syndrome (STSS)</term>, which results from massive superantigen production that leads to septic shock and death.</para>

<title>Sequelae of <emphasis effect="italics">S. pyogenes</emphasis> Infections</title>
<para id="fs-id1167661294472">One reason strep throat infections are aggressively treated with antibiotics is because they can lead to serious <term id="term-00015">sequelae</term>, later clinical consequences of a primary infection. It is estimated that 1%–3% of untreated <emphasis effect="italics">S. pyogenes</emphasis> infections can be followed by nonsuppurative (without the production of pus) sequelae that develop 1–3 weeks after the acute infection has resolved. Two such sequelae are <term id="term-00016">acute rheumatic fever</term> and <term id="term-00017">acute glomerulonephritis</term>.</para>
<para id="fs-id1167663980947">Acute rheumatic fever can follow pharyngitis caused by specific rheumatogenic strains of <emphasis effect="italics">S. pyogenes</emphasis> (strains 1, 3, 5, 6, and 18). Although the exact mechanism responsible for this sequela remains unclear, molecular mimicry between the M protein of rheumatogenic strains of <emphasis effect="italics">S. pyogenes</emphasis> and heart tissue is thought to initiate the autoimmune attack. The most serious and lethal clinical manifestation of rheumatic fever is damage to and inflammation of the heart (<term class="no-emphasis" id="term-00018">carditis</term>). Acute glomerulonephritis also results from an immune response to streptococcal antigens following pharyngitis and cutaneous infections. Acute glomerulonephritis develops within 6–10 days after pharyngitis, but can take up to 21 days after a cutaneous infection. Similar to acute rheumatic fever, there are strong associations between specific nephritogenic strains of <emphasis effect="italics">S. pyogenes</emphasis> and acute glomerulonephritis, and evidence suggests a role for antigen mimicry and autoimmunity. However, the primary mechanism of acute glomerulonephritis appears to be the formation of immune complexes between <emphasis effect="italics">S. pyogenes</emphasis> antigens and antibodies, and their deposition between endothelial cells of the glomeruli of kidney. Inflammatory response against the immune complexes leads to damage and inflammation of the glomeruli (glomerulonephritis).</para>

<title>Acute Otitis Media</title>
<para id="fs-id1167661308707">An infection of the <term class="no-emphasis" id="term-00019">middle ear</term> is called <term id="term-00020">acute otitis media</term> (<term id="term-00021">AOM</term>), but often it is simply referred to as an earache. The condition is most common between ages 3 months and 3 years. In the United States, AOM is the second-leading cause of visits to pediatricians by children younger than age 5 years, and it is the leading indication for antibiotic prescription.<footnote id="fs-id1167663619620">G. Worrall. “Acute Otitis Media.” <emphasis effect="italics">Canadian Family Physician</emphasis> 53 no. 12 (2007):2147–2148.</footnote></para>
<para id="fs-id1167663523952">AOM is characterized by the formation and accumulation of pus in the middle ear. Unable to drain, the pus builds up, resulting in moderate to severe bulging of the tympanic membrane and otalgia (ear pain). Inflammation resulting from the infection leads to swelling of the eustachian tubes, and may also lead to fever, nausea, vomiting, and diarrhea, particularly in infants. Infants and toddlers who cannot yet speak may exhibit nonverbal signs suggesting AOM, such as holding, tugging, or rubbing of the ear, as well as uncharacteristic crying or distress in response to the pain.</para>
<para id="fs-id1167663969371">AOM can be caused by a variety of bacteria. Among neonates, <emphasis effect="italics">S. pneumoniae</emphasis> is the most common cause of AOM, but <term class="no-emphasis" id="term-00022"><emphasis effect="italics">Escherichia coli</emphasis></term>, <emphasis effect="italics">Enterococcus</emphasis> spp., and <term class="no-emphasis" id="term-00023">group B <emphasis effect="italics">Streptococcus</emphasis></term> species can also be involved. In older infants and children younger than 14 years old, the most common bacterial causes are <emphasis effect="italics">S. pneumoniae</emphasis>, <term class="no-emphasis" id="term-00024"><emphasis effect="italics">Haemophilus influenzae</emphasis></term>, or <term class="no-emphasis" id="term-00025"><emphasis effect="italics">Moraxella catarrhalis</emphasis></term>. Among <emphasis effect="italics">S. pneumoniae</emphasis> infections<emphasis effect="italics">,</emphasis> encapsulated strains are frequent causes of AOM. By contrast, the strains of <emphasis effect="italics">H. influenzae</emphasis> and <emphasis effect="italics">M. cattarhalis</emphasis> that are responsible for AOM do not possess a capsule. Rather than direct tissue damage by these pathogens, bacterial components such as lipopolysaccharide (LPS) in gram-negative pathogens induce an inflammatory response that causes swelling, pus, and tissue damage within the middle ear (<link target-id="OSC_Microbio_22_02_OtitisMed"/>).</para>
<para id="fs-id1167663989301">Any blockage of the eustachian tubes, with or without infection, can cause fluid to become trapped and accumulate in the middle ear. This is referred to as <term id="term-00026">otitis media with effusion (OME)</term>. The accumulated fluid offers an excellent reservoir for microbial growth and, consequently, secondary bacterial infections often ensue. This can lead to recurring and chronic earaches, which are especially common in young children. The higher incidence in children can be attributed to many factors. Children have more upper respiratory infections, in general, and their eustachian tubes are also shorter and drain at a shallower angle. Young children also tend to spend more time lying down than adults, which facilitates drainage from the nasopharynx through the eustachian tube and into the middle ear. Bottle feeding while lying down enhances this risk because the sucking action on the bottle causes negative pressure to build up within the eustachian tube, promoting the movement of fluid and bacteria from the nasopharynx.</para>
<para id="fs-id1167663948854">Diagnosis is typically made based on clinical signs and symptoms, without laboratory testing to determine the specific causative agent. Antibiotics are frequently prescribed for the treatment of AOM. High-dose <term class="no-emphasis" id="term-00027">amoxicillin</term> is the first-line drug, but with increasing resistance concerns, macrolides and <term class="no-emphasis" id="term-00028">cephalosporin</term>s may also be used. The pneumococcal conjugate vaccine (PCV13) contains serotypes that are important causes of AOM, and vaccination has been shown to decrease the incidence of AOM. Vaccination against influenza has also been shown to decrease the risk for AOM, likely because viral infections like influenza predispose patients to secondary infections with <emphasis effect="italics">S. pneumoniae</emphasis>. Although there is a conjugate vaccine available for the invasive serotype B of <emphasis effect="italics">H. influenzae</emphasis>, this vaccine does not impact the incidence of <emphasis effect="italics">H. influenzae</emphasis> AOM. Because unencapsulated strains of <emphasis effect="italics">H. influenzae</emphasis> and <emphasis effect="italics">M. catarrhalis</emphasis> are involved in AOM, vaccines against bacterial cellular factors other than capsules will need to be developed.</para>

<title>Bacterial Rhinosinusitis</title>
<para id="fs-id1167661353008">The microbial community of the nasopharynx is extremely diverse and harbors many opportunistic pathogens, so it is perhaps not surprising that infections leading to <term class="no-emphasis" id="term-00029">rhinitis</term> and <term class="no-emphasis" id="term-00030">sinusitis</term> have many possible causes. These conditions often occur as secondary infections after a viral infection, which effectively compromises the immune defenses and allows the opportunistic bacteria to establish themselves. Bacterial sinusitis involves infection and inflammation within the paranasal sinuses. Because bacterial sinusitis rarely occurs without rhinitis, the preferred term is <term class="no-emphasis" id="term-00031">rhinosinusitis</term>.

<title>Diphtheria</title>
<para id="fs-id1167664000306">The causative agent of <term id="term-00032">diphtheria</term>, <term class="no-emphasis" id="term-00033"><emphasis effect="italics">Corynebacterium diphtheriae</emphasis></term>, is a club-shaped, gram-positive rod that belongs to the phylum <term class="no-emphasis" id="term-00034">Actinobacteria</term>. Diphtheroids are common members of the normal nasopharyngeal microbiota. However, some strains of <emphasis effect="italics">C. diphtheriae</emphasis> become pathogenic because of the presence of a temperate bacteriophage-encoded protein—the <term class="no-emphasis" id="term-00035">diphtheria toxin</term>. Diphtheria is typically a respiratory infection of the oropharynx but can also cause impetigo-like lesions on the skin. Although the disease can affect people of all ages, it tends to be most severe in those younger than 5 years or older than 40 years. Like strep throat, diphtheria is commonly transmitted in the droplets and aerosols produced by coughing. After colonizing the throat, the bacterium remains in the oral cavity and begins producing the diphtheria toxin. This protein is an <term class="no-emphasis" id="term-00036">A-B toxin</term> that blocks host-cell protein synthesis by inactivating elongation factor (EF)-2 (see <link document="m58868">Virulence Factors of Bacterial and Viral Pathogens</link>). The toxin’s action leads to the death of the host cells and an inflammatory response. An accumulation of grayish exudate consisting of dead host cells, pus, red blood cells, fibrin, and infectious bacteria results in the formation of a <term id="term-00037">pseudomembrane</term>. The pseudomembrane can cover mucous membranes of the nasal cavity, tonsils, pharynx, and larynx (<link target-id="OSC_Microbio_22_02_Diphtheria"/>). This is a classic sign of diphtheria. As the disease progresses, the pseudomembrane can enlarge to obstruct the fauces of the pharynx or trachea and can lead to suffocation and death. Sometimes, <term id="term-00038">intubation</term>, the placement of a breathing tube in the trachea, is required in advanced infections. If the diphtheria toxin spreads throughout the body, it can damage other tissues as well. This can include myocarditis (heart damage) and nerve damage that may impair breathing.</para>

</figure>
<para id="fs-id1167661433769">The presumptive diagnosis of diphtheria is primarily based on the clinical symptoms (i.e., the pseudomembrane) and vaccination history, and is typically confirmed by identifying bacterial cultures obtained from throat swabs. The diphtheria toxin itself can be directly detected in vitro using polymerase chain reaction (PCR)-based, direct detection systems for the diphtheria <emphasis effect="italics">tox</emphasis> gene, and immunological techniques like radial immunodiffusion or Elek’s immunodiffusion test.</para>
<para id="fs-id1167661439133">Broad-spectrum antibiotics like penicillin and erythromycin tend to effectively control <emphasis effect="italics">C. diphtheriae</emphasis> infections. Regrettably, they have no effect against preformed toxins. If toxin production has already occurred in the patient, antitoxins (preformed antibodies against the toxin) are administered. Although this is effective in neutralizing the toxin, the antitoxins may lead to <term class="no-emphasis" id="term-00039">serum sickness</term> because they are produced in horses (see <link document="m58892">Hypersensitivities</link>).</para>
<para id="fs-id1167663989619">Widespread vaccination efforts have reduced the occurrence of diphtheria worldwide. There are currently four combination toxoid vaccines available that provide protection against diphtheria and other diseases: DTaP, Tdap, DT, and Td. In all cases, the letters “d,” “t,” and “p” stand for diphtheria, tetanus, and pertussis, respectively; the “a” stands for acellular. If capitalized, the letters indicate a full-strength dose; lowercase letters indicate reduced dosages. According to current recommendations, children should receive five doses of the DTaP vaccine in their youth and a Td booster every 10 years. Children with adverse reactions to the pertussis vaccine may be given the DT vaccine in place of the DTaP.</para>

<title>Bacterial Pneumonia</title>
<para id="fs-id1167663733474">Pneumonia is a general term for infections of the lungs that lead to inflammation and accumulation of fluids and white blood cells in the alveoli. Pneumonia can be caused by bacteria, viruses, fungi, and other organisms, although the vast majority of pneumonias are bacterial in origin. Bacterial pneumonia is a prevalent, potentially serious infection; it caused more 50,000 deaths in the United States in 2014.<footnote id="fs-id1167663965483">KD Kochanek et al. “Deaths: Final Data for 2014.” <emphasis effect="italics">National Vital Statistics Reports</emphasis> 65 no 4 (2016).</footnote> As the alveoli fill with fluids and white blood cells (consolidation), air exchange becomes impaired and patients experience respiratory distress (<link target-id="OSC_Microbio_22_02_Pneumonia"/>). In addition, pneumonia can lead to <term class="no-emphasis" id="term-00040">pleurisy</term>, an infection of the pleural membrane surrounding the lungs, which can make breathing very painful. Although many different bacteria can cause pneumonia under the right circumstances, three bacterial species cause most clinical cases: <term class="no-emphasis" id="term-00041"><emphasis effect="italics">Streptococcus pneumoniae</emphasis></term>, <term class="no-emphasis" id="term-00042"><emphasis effect="italics">H</emphasis>. <emphasis effect="italics">influenzae</emphasis></term>, and <term class="no-emphasis" id="term-00043"><emphasis effect="italics">Mycoplasma pneumoniae</emphasis></term>.

<title>Pneumococcal Pneumonia</title>
<para id="fs-id1167661440876">The most common cause of community-acquired bacterial pneumonia is <emphasis effect="italics">Streptococcus pneumoniae</emphasis>. This gram-positive, alpha hemolytic streptococcus is commonly found as part of the normal microbiota of the human respiratory tract. The cells tend to be somewhat lancet-shaped and typically appear as pairs (<link target-id="OSC_Microbio_22_02_Pneumococ"/>). The pneumococci initially colonize the bronchioles of the lungs. Eventually, the infection spreads to the alveoli, where the microbe’s polysaccharide capsule interferes with phagocytic clearance. Other virulence factors include <term class="no-emphasis" id="term-00044">autolysin</term>s like Lyt A, which degrade the microbial cell wall, resulting in cell lysis and the release of cytoplasmic virulence factors. One of these factors, <term class="no-emphasis" id="term-00045">pneumolysin O</term>, is important in disease progression; this pore-forming protein damages host cells, promotes bacterial adherence, and enhances pro-inflammatory cytokine production. The resulting inflammatory response causes the alveoli to fill with exudate rich in neutrophils and red blood cells. As a consequence, infected individuals develop a productive cough with bloody sputum.</para>

<para id="fs-id1167663572436">Why is it that some individuals become seriously ill from bacterial infections that seem to have little or no effect on others? The pathogenicity of an organism—its ability to cause host damage—is not solely a property of the microorganism. Rather, it is the product of a complex relationship between the microbe’s virulence factors and the immune defenses of the individual. Preexisting conditions and environmental factors such as exposure to secondhand smoke can make some individuals more susceptible to infection by producing conditions favorable to microbial growth or compromising the immune system. In addition, individuals may have genetically determined immune factors that protect them—or not—from particular strains of pathogens. The interactions between these host factors and the pathogenicity factors produced by the microorganism ultimately determine the outcome of the infection. A clearer understanding of these interactions may allow for better identification of at-risk individuals and prophylactic interventions in the future.</para>

The cells are phagocytized by macrophages but can survive and multiply within these phagocytes because of the protection by the waxy mycolic acid in their cell walls. If not eliminated by macrophages, the infection can progress, causing an inflammatory response and an accumulation of neutrophils and macrophages in the area. Several weeks or months may pass before an immunological response is mounted by T cells and B cells. Eventually, the lesions in the alveoli become walled off, forming small round lesions called <term id="term-00074">tubercles</term>. Bacteria continue to be released into the center of the tubercles and the chronic immune response results in tissue damage and induction of apoptosis (programmed host-cell death) in a process called liquefaction. This creates a caseous center, or air pocket, where the aerobic <emphasis effect="italics">M. tuberculosis</emphasis> can grow and multiply. Tubercles may eventually rupture and bacterial cells can invade pulmonary capillaries; from there, bacteria can spread through the bloodstream to other organs, a condition known as <term id="term-00075">miliary tuberculosis</term>. The rupture of tubercles also facilitates transmission of the bacteria to other individuals via droplet aerosols that exit the body in coughs.

<title>Pertussis (Whooping Cough)</title>
<para id="fs-id1167663990307">The causative agent of <term id="term-00080">pertussis</term>, commonly called <term id="term-00081">whooping cough</term>, is <term class="no-emphasis" id="term-00082"><emphasis effect="italics">Bordetella pertussis</emphasis></term>, a gram-negative coccobacillus. The disease is characterized by mucus accumulation in the lungs that leads to a long period of severe coughing. Sometimes, following a bout of coughing, a sound resembling a “whoop” is produced as air is inhaled through the inflamed and restricted airway—hence the name whooping cough. Although adults can be infected, the symptoms of this disease are most pronounced in infants and children. Pertussis is highly communicable through droplet transmission, so the uncontrollable coughing produced is an efficient means of transmitting the disease in a susceptible population.</para>
<para id="fs-id1167661441090">Following inhalation, <emphasis effect="italics">B. pertussis</emphasis> specifically attaches to epithelial cells using an <term class="no-emphasis" id="term-00083">adhesin</term>, filamentous hemagglutinin. The bacteria then grow at the site of infection and cause disease symptoms through the production of exotoxins. One of the main virulence factors of this organism is an <term class="no-emphasis" id="term-00084">A-B exotoxin</term> called the <term id="term-00085">pertussis toxin (PT)</term>. When PT enters the host cells, it increases the cyclic adenosine monophosphate (cAMP) levels and disrupts cellular signaling. PT is known to enhance inflammatory responses involving histamine and serotonin. In addition to PT, <emphasis effect="italics">B. pertussis</emphasis> produces a tracheal cytotoxin that damages ciliated epithelial cells and results in accumulation of mucus in the lungs. The mucus can support the colonization and growth of other microbes and, as a consequence, secondary infections are common. Together, the effects of these factors produce the cough that characterizes this infection.</para>
<para id="fs-id1167663670787">A pertussis infection can be divided into three distinct stages. The initial infection, termed the <term id="term-00086">catarrhal stage</term>, is relatively mild and unremarkable. The signs and symptoms may include nasal congestion, a runny nose, sneezing, and a low-grade fever. This, however, is the stage in which <emphasis effect="italics">B. pertussis</emphasis> is most infectious. In the <term id="term-00087">paroxysmal stage</term>, mucus accumulation leads to uncontrollable coughing spasms that can last for several minutes and frequently induce vomiting. The paroxysmal stage can last for several weeks. A long <term id="term-00088">convalescence stage</term> follows the paroxysmal stage, during which time patients experience a chronic cough that can last for up to several months. In fact, the disease is sometimes called the 100-day cough.</para>

Although this disease primarily affects the lungs, it can also cause fever, nausea, vomiting, confusion, and other neurological effects.</para>
<para id="fs-id1167661443922">Diagnosis of Legionnaires disease is somewhat complicated. <emphasis effect="italics">L. pneumophila</emphasis> is a fastidious bacterium and is difficult to culture. In addition, since the bacterial cells are not efficiently stained with the Gram stain, other staining techniques, such as the <term class="no-emphasis" id="term-00095">Warthin-Starry silver-precipitate procedure</term>, must be used to visualize this pathogen. A rapid diagnostic test has been developed that detects the presence of <emphasis effect="italics">Legionella</emphasis> antigen in a patient’s urine; results take less than 1 hour, and the test has high selectivity and specificity (greater than 90%). Unfortunately, the test only works for one serotype of <emphasis effect="italics">L. pneumophila</emphasis> (type 1, the serotype responsible for most infections). Consequently, isolation and identification of <emphasis effect="italics">L. pneumophila</emphasis> from sputum remains the defining test for diagnosis.</para>

<title>Q Fever</title>
<para id="fs-id1167661298148">The zoonotic disease <term id="term-00096">Q fever</term> is caused by a rickettsia, <term class="no-emphasis" id="term-00097"><emphasis effect="italics">Coxiella burnetii</emphasis></term>. The primary reservoirs for this bacterium are domesticated livestock such as cattle, sheep, and goats. The bacterium may be transmitted by ticks or through exposure to the urine, feces, milk, or amniotic fluid of an infected animal. In humans, the primary route of infection is through inhalation of contaminated farmyard aerosols. It is, therefore, largely an occupational disease of farmers. Humans are acutely sensitive to <emphasis effect="italics">C. burnetii</emphasis>—the infective dose is estimated to be just a few cells.<footnote id="fs-id1167661366603">WD Tigertt et al. “Airborne Q Fever.” <emphasis effect="italics">Bacteriological Reviews</emphasis> 25 no. 3 (1961):285–293.</footnote> In addition, the organism is hardy and can survive in a dry environment for an extended time.

<para id="fs-id1167661367334">Diagnosing rickettsial infection by cultivation in the laboratory is both difficult and hazardous because of the easy aerosolization of the bacteria, so PCR and ELISA are commonly used.

<title>Key Concepts and Summary</title>
<list id="fs-id1167663980370" list-type="bulleted" bullet-style="bullet">
<item>A wide variety of bacteria can cause respiratory diseases; most are treatable with antibiotics or preventable with vaccines.</item>
<item><emphasis effect="italics">Streptococcus pyogenes</emphasis> causes <emphasis effect="bold">strep throat</emphasis>, an infection of the pharynx that also causes high fever and can lead to <emphasis effect="bold">scarlet fever</emphasis>, <emphasis effect="bold">acute rheumatic fever</emphasis>, and <emphasis effect="bold">acute glomerulonephritis</emphasis>.</item>
<item><emphasis effect="bold">Acute otitis media</emphasis> is an infection of the middle ear that may be caused by several bacteria, including <emphasis effect="italics">Streptococcus pneumoniae, Haemophilus influenzae,</emphasis> and <emphasis effect="italics">Moraxella catarrhalis</emphasis>. The infection can block the eustachian tubes, leading to <emphasis effect="bold">otitis media with effusion</emphasis>.</item>
<item><emphasis effect="bold">Diphtheria</emphasis>, caused by <emphasis effect="italics">Corynebacterium diphtheriae</emphasis>, is now a rare disease because of widespread vaccination. The bacteria produce exotoxins that kill cells in the pharynx, leading to the formation of a <emphasis effect="bold">pseudomembrane</emphasis>; and damage other parts of the body.</item>
<item><emphasis effect="bold">Bacterial</emphasis> <emphasis effect="bold">pneumonia</emphasis> results from infections that cause inflammation and fluid accumulation in the alveoli. It is most commonly caused by <emphasis effect="italics">S. pneumoniae</emphasis> or <emphasis effect="italics">H. influenzae</emphasis>. The former is commonly multidrug resistant.</item>
<item><emphasis effect="bold"><emphasis effect="italics">Mycoplasma</emphasis> pneumonia</emphasis> results from infection by <emphasis effect="italics">Mycoplasma pneumoniae</emphasis>; it can spread quickly, but the disease is mild and self-limiting.</item>
<item><emphasis effect="bold">Chlamydial pneumonia</emphasis> can be caused by three pathogens that are obligate intracellular parasites. <emphasis effect="italics">Chlamydia pneumoniae</emphasis> is typically transmitted from an infected person, whereas <emphasis effect="italics">C. psittaci</emphasis> is typically transmitted from an infected bird. <emphasis effect="italics">Chlamydia trachomatis</emphasis>, may cause pneumonia in infants.</item>
<item>Several other bacteria can cause pneumonia in immunocompromised individuals and those with cystic fibrosis.</item>
<item><emphasis effect="bold">Tuberculosis</emphasis> is caused by <emphasis effect="italics">Mycobacterium tuberculosis</emphasis>. Infection leads to the production of protective <emphasis effect="bold">tubercles</emphasis> in the alveoli and calcified <emphasis effect="bold">Ghon complexes</emphasis> that can harbor the bacteria for a long time. Antibiotic-resistant forms are common and treatment is typically long term.</item>
<item><emphasis effect="bold">Pertussis</emphasis> is caused by <emphasis effect="italics">Bordetella pertussis</emphasis>. Mucus accumulation in the lungs leads to prolonged severe coughing episodes (whooping cough) that facilitate transmission. Despite an available vaccine, outbreaks are still common.</item>
<item><emphasis effect="bold">Legionnaires disease</emphasis> is caused by infection from environmental reservoirs of the <emphasis effect="italics">Legionella pneumophila</emphasis> bacterium. The bacterium is endocytic within macrophages and infection can lead to pneumonia, particularly among immunocompromised individuals.</item>
<item><emphasis effect="bold">Q fever</emphasis> is caused by <emphasis effect="italics">Coxiella burnetii</emphasis>, whose primary hosts are domesticated mammals (zoonotic disease). It causes pneumonia primarily in farm workers and can lead to serious complications, such as endocarditis.</item>
