<title>Bacterial Vaginitis and Vaginosis</title>
<para id="fs-id1167662797084">Inflammation of the vagina is called <term class="no-emphasis" id="term-00001">vaginitis</term>, often caused by a bacterial infection. It is also possible to have an imbalance in the normal <term class="no-emphasis" id="term-00002">vaginal microbiota</term> without inflammation called <term id="term-00003">bacterial vaginosis (BV)</term>. Vaginosis may be asymptomatic or may cause mild symptoms such as a thin, white-to-yellow, homogeneous vaginal discharge, burning, odor, and itching. The major causative agent is <term class="no-emphasis" id="term-00004"><emphasis effect="italics">Gardnerella vaginalis</emphasis></term>, a gram-variable to gram-negative pleomorphic bacterium. Other causative agents include anaerobic species such as members of the genera <term class="no-emphasis" id="term-00005"><emphasis effect="italics">Bacteroides</emphasis></term> and <term class="no-emphasis" id="term-00006"><emphasis effect="italics">Fusobacterium</emphasis></term>. Additionally, ureaplasma and mycoplasma may be involved. The disease is usually self-limiting, although antibiotic treatment is recommended if symptoms develop.</para>
<para id="fs-id1167662784892"><emphasis effect="italics">G. vaginalis</emphasis> appears to be more virulent than other vaginal bacterial species potentially associated with BV. Like <term class="no-emphasis" id="term-00007"><emphasis effect="italics">Lactobacillus</emphasis></term> spp., <emphasis effect="italics">G. vaginalis</emphasis> is part of the normal vaginal microbiota, but when the population of <emphasis effect="italics">Lactobacillus</emphasis> spp. decreases and the <term class="no-emphasis" id="term-00008">vaginal pH</term> increases, <emphasis effect="italics">G. vaginalis</emphasis> flourishes, causing vaginosis by attaching to vaginal epithelial cells and forming a thick protective <term class="no-emphasis" id="term-00009">biofilm</term>. <emphasis effect="italics">G. vaginalis</emphasis> also produces a cytotoxin called <term class="no-emphasis" id="term-00010">vaginolysin</term> that lyses vaginal epithelial cells and red blood cells.</para>
<para id="fs-id1167662473394">Since <emphasis effect="italics">G. vaginalis</emphasis> can also be isolated from healthy females, the “gold standard” for the diagnosis of BV is direct examination of vaginal secretions and not the culture of <emphasis effect="italics">G. vaginalis</emphasis>. Diagnosis of bacterial vaginosis from vaginal secretions can be accurately made in three ways. The first is to use a <term class="no-emphasis" id="term-00011">DNA probe</term>. The second method is to assay for <term class="no-emphasis" id="term-00012">sialidase activity</term> (sialidase is an enzyme produced by <emphasis effect="italics">G. vaginalis</emphasis> and other bacteria associated with vaginosis, including <emphasis effect="italics">Bacteroides</emphasis> spp., <term class="no-emphasis" id="term-00013"><emphasis effect="italics">Prevotella</emphasis></term> spp., and <term class="no-emphasis" id="term-00014"><emphasis effect="italics">Mobiluncus</emphasis></term> spp.). The third method is to assess gram-stained vaginal smears for microscopic morphology and relative numbers and types of bacteria, squamous epithelial cells, and leukocytes. By examining slides prepared from <term class="no-emphasis" id="term-00015">vaginal swabs</term>, it is possible to distinguish lactobacilli (long, gram-positive rods) from other gram-negative species responsible for BV. A shift in predominance from gram-positive bacilli to gram-negative coccobacilli can indicate BV. Additionally, the slide may contain so-called <term class="no-emphasis" id="term-00016">clue cells</term>, which are epithelial cells that appear to have a granular or stippled appearance due to bacterial cells attached to their surface (<link target-id="OSC_Microbio_23_03_VagSmear"/>). Presumptive diagnosis of bacterial vaginosis can involve an assessment of clinical symptoms and evaluation of vaginal fluids using <term class="no-emphasis" id="term-00017">Amsel’s diagnostic criteria</term> which include 3 out of 4 of the following characteristics:</para>

</list>
<para id="fs-id1167662405783">Treatment is often unnecessary because the infection often clears on its own. However, in some cases, antibiotics such as topical or oral <term class="no-emphasis" id="term-00018">clindamycin</term> or <term class="no-emphasis" id="term-00019">metronidazole</term> may be prescribed.

<title>Gonorrhea</title>
<para id="fs-id1167662394301">Also known as the clap, <term id="term-00021">gonorrhea</term> is a common sexually transmitted disease of the reproductive system that is especially prevalent in individuals between the ages of 15 and 24. It is caused by <term class="no-emphasis" id="term-00022"><emphasis effect="italics">Neisseria gonorrhoeae</emphasis></term>, often called gonococcus or GC, which have fimbriae that allow the cells to attach to epithelial cells. It also has a type of lipopolysaccharide endotoxin called <term class="no-emphasis" id="term-00023">lipooligosaccharide</term> as part of the outer membrane structure that enhances its pathogenicity. In addition to causing <term class="no-emphasis" id="term-00024">urethritis</term>, <emphasis effect="italics">N. gonorrhoeae</emphasis> can infect other body tissues such as the skin, meninges, pharynx, and conjunctiva.</para>
<para id="fs-id1167662447189">Many infected individuals are asymptomatic carriers of gonorrhea. When symptoms do occur, they manifest differently in males and females. Males may develop pain and burning during urination and discharge from the penis that may be yellow, green, or white (<link target-id="OSC_Microbio_23_03_Gonorrheae"/>). Less commonly, the testicles may become swollen or tender. Over time, these symptoms can increase and spread. In some cases, chronic infection develops. The disease can also develop in the rectum, causing symptoms such as discharge, soreness, bleeding, itching, and pain (especially in association with bowel movements).</para>

<para id="fs-id1167660273469">Females may develop pelvic pain, discharge from the vagina, intermenstrual bleeding (i.e., bleeding not associated with normal menstruation), and pain or irritation associated with urination. As with males, the infection can become chronic. In females, however, chronic infection can cause increases in menstrual flow. Rectal infection can also occur, with the symptoms previously described for males. Infections that spread to the endometrium and fallopian tubes can cause <term class="no-emphasis" id="term-00025">pelvic inflammatory disease (PID)</term>, characterized by pain in the lower abdominal region, <term class="no-emphasis" id="term-00026">dysuria</term>, vaginal discharge, and fever. PID can also lead to infertility through scarring and blockage of the fallopian tubes (<term class="no-emphasis" id="term-00027">salpingitis</term>); it may also increase the risk of a life-threatening <term class="no-emphasis" id="term-00028">ectopic pregnancy</term>, which occurs when a fertilized egg begins developing somewhere other than the uterus (e.g., in the fallopian tube or ovary).</para>
<para id="fs-id1167662357810">When a gonorrhea infection disseminates throughout the body, serious complications can develop.

<title>Antibiotic Resistance in <emphasis effect="italics">Neisseria</emphasis></title>
<para id="fs-id1167662489938">Antibiotic resistance in many pathogens is steadily increasing, causing serious concern throughout the public health community. Increased resistance has been especially notable in some species, such as <emphasis effect="italics">Neisseria gonorrhoeae</emphasis>. The CDC monitors the spread of antibiotic resistance in <emphasis effect="italics">N. gonorrhoeae</emphasis>, which it classifies as an urgent threat, and makes recommendations for treatment. So far, <emphasis effect="italics">N. gonorrhoeae</emphasis> has shown resistance to cefixime (a cephalosporin), ceftriaxone (another cephalosporin), azithromycin, and tetracycline. Resistance to tetracycline is the most common, and was seen in 188,600 cases of gonorrhea in 2011 (out of a total 820,000 cases). In 2011, some 246,000 cases of gonorrhea involved strains of <emphasis effect="italics">N. gonorrhoeae</emphasis> that were resistant to at least one antibiotic.<footnote id="fs-id1167660268461">Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. “Antibiotic Resistance Threats in the United States, 2013,” 2013. http://www.cdc.gov/drugresistance/pdf/ar-threats-2013-508.pdf. </footnote> These resistance genes are spread by plasmids, and a single bacterium may be resistant to multiple antibiotics. The CDC currently recommends treatment with two medications, ceftriaxone and azithromycin, to attempt to slow the spread of resistance.

While many <emphasis effect="italics">Chlamydia</emphasis> infections are asymptomatic, chlamydia is a major cause of nongonococcal urethritis (NGU) and may also cause <term class="no-emphasis" id="term-00040">epididymitis</term> and <term class="no-emphasis" id="term-00041">orchitis</term> in males.

<title>Syphilis</title>
<para id="fs-id1167662605145"><term id="term-00049">Syphilis</term> is spread through direct physical (generally sexual) contact, and is caused by the gram-negative spirochete <term class="no-emphasis" id="term-00050"><emphasis effect="italics">Treponema pallidum</emphasis></term>. <emphasis effect="italics">T. pallidum</emphasis> has a relatively simple genome and lacks lipopolysaccharide endotoxin characteristic of gram-negative bacteria. However, it does contain lipoproteins that trigger an immune response in the host, causing tissue damage that may enhance the pathogen’s ability to disseminate while evading the host immune system.</para>
<para id="fs-id1167662443034">After entering the body, <emphasis effect="italics">T. pallidum</emphasis> moves rapidly into the bloodstream and other tissues. If not treated effectively, syphilis progresses through three distinct stages: primary, secondary, and tertiary. Primary syphilis appears as a single lesion on the cervix, penis, or anus within 10 to 90 days of transmission. Such lesions contain many <emphasis effect="italics">T. pallidum</emphasis> cells and are highly infectious. The lesion, called a <term id="term-00051">hard chancre</term>, is initially hard and painless, but it soon develops into an ulcerated sore (<link target-id="OSC_Microbio_23_03_SyphStages"/>). Localized lymph node swelling may occur as well. In some cases, these symptoms may be relatively mild, and the lesion may heal on its own within two to six weeks. Because the lesions are painless and often occur in hidden locations (e.g., the cervix or anus), infected individuals sometimes do not notice them.</para>
<para id="fs-id1167662493127">The secondary stage generally develops once the primary chancre has healed or begun to heal. Secondary syphilis is characterized by a rash that affects the skin and mucous membranes of the mouth, vagina, or anus. The rash often begins on the palms or the soles of the feet and spreads to the trunk and the limbs (<link target-id="OSC_Microbio_23_03_SyphStages"/>). The rash may take many forms, such as macular or papular. On mucous membranes, it may manifest as mucus patches or white, wartlike lesions called condylomata lata. The rash may be accompanied by malaise, fever, and swelling of lymph nodes. Individuals are highly contagious in the secondary stage, which lasts two to six weeks and is recurrent in about 25% of cases.</para>
<para id="fs-id1167662450530">After the secondary phase, syphilis can enter a latent phase, in which there are no symptoms but microbial levels remain high. Blood tests can still detect the disease during latency. The latent phase can persist for years.</para>
<para id="fs-id1167662863392">Tertiary syphilis, which may occur 10 to 20 years after infection, produces the most severe symptoms and can be fatal. Granulomatous lesions called <term id="term-00052">gummas</term> may develop in a variety of locations, including mucous membranes, bones, and internal organs (<link target-id="OSC_Microbio_23_03_SyphStages"/>). Gummas can be large and destructive, potentially causing massive tissue damage. The most deadly lesions are those of the cardiovascular system (cardiovascular syphilis) and the central nervous system (neurosyphilis). Cardiovascular syphilis can result in a fatal aortic aneurysm (rupture of the aorta) or coronary stenosis (a blockage of the coronary artery). Damage to the central nervous system can cause dementia, personality changes, seizures, general paralysis, speech impairment, loss of vision and hearing, and loss of bowel and bladder control.</para>

</figure>
<para id="fs-id1167660271821">The recommended methods for diagnosing early syphilis are darkfield or brightfield (silver stain) microscopy of tissue or exudate from lesions to detect <emphasis effect="italics">T. pallidum</emphasis> (<link target-id="OSC_Microbio_23_03_Treponema"/>). If these methods are not available, two types of serologic tests (treponemal and nontreponemal) can be used for a presumptive diagnosis once the spirochete has spread in the body. <term id="term-00053">Nontreponemal serologic tests</term> include the <term class="no-emphasis" id="term-00054">Venereal Disease Research Laboratory</term> (VDRL) and <term class="no-emphasis" id="term-00055">rapid plasma reagin</term> (RPR) tests. These are similar screening tests that detect nonspecific antibodies (those for lipid antigens produced during infection) rather than those produced against the spirochete. <term id="term-00056">Treponemal serologic tests</term> measure antibodies directed against <emphasis effect="italics">T. pallidum</emphasis> antigens using particle agglutination (<emphasis effect="italics">T. pallidum</emphasis> passive particle agglutination or TP-PA), immunofluorescence (the fluorescent <emphasis effect="italics">T. pallidum</emphasis> antibody absorption or FTA-ABS), various enzyme reactions (enzyme immunoassays or EIAs) and chemiluminescence immunoassays (CIA). Confirmatory testing, rather than screening, must be done using treponemal rather than nontreponemal tests because only the former tests for antibodies to spirochete antigens. Both treponemal and nontreponemal tests should be used (as opposed to just one) since both tests have limitations than can result in false positives or false negatives.</para>
<para id="fs-id1167662779879">Neurosyphilis cannot be diagnosed using a single test. With or without clinical signs, it is generally necessary to assess a variety of factors, including reactive serologic test results, cerebrospinal fluid cell count abnormalities, cerebrospinal fluid protein abnormalities, or reactive VDRL-CSF (the VDRL test of cerebrospinal fluid). The VDRL-CSF is highly specific, but not sufficiently sensitive for conclusive diagnosis.</para>

<para id="fs-id1167662407283">The sexually transmitted infection <term id="term-00062">chancroid</term> is caused by the gram-negative rod <term class="no-emphasis" id="term-00063"><emphasis effect="italics">Haemophilus ducreyi</emphasis></term>. It is characterized by <term id="term-00064">soft chancres</term> <emphasis effect="bold">(</emphasis><link target-id="OSC_Microbio_23_03_Chancroid"/>) on the genitals or other areas associated with sexual contact, such as the mouth and anus. Unlike the hard chancres associated with syphilis, soft chancres develop into painful, open sores that may bleed or produce fluid that is highly contagious. In addition to causing chancres, the bacteria can invade the lymph nodes, potentially leading to pus discharge through the skin from lymph nodes in the groin. Like other genital lesions, soft chancres are of particular concern because they compromise the protective barriers of the skin or mucous membranes, making individuals more susceptible to HIV and other sexually transmitted diseases.</para>
<para id="fs-id1167662904042">Several virulence factors have been associated with <emphasis effect="italics">H. ducreyi</emphasis>, including <term class="no-emphasis" id="term-00065">lipooligosaccharide</term>s, protective outer membrane proteins, <term class="no-emphasis" id="term-00066">antiphagocytic proteins</term>, secretory proteins, and <term class="no-emphasis" id="term-00067">collagen-specific adhesin NcaA</term>.

<title>Bacterial Reproductive Tract Infections</title>
<para id="fs-id1167662849559">Many bacterial infections affecting the reproductive system are transmitted through sexual contact, but some can be transmitted by other means. In the United States, gonorrhea and chlamydia are common illnesses with incidences of about 350,000 and 1.44 million, respectively, in 2014. Syphilis is a rarer disease with an incidence of 20,000 in 2014. Chancroid is exceedingly rare in the United States with only six cases in 2014 and a median of 10 cases per year for the years 2010–2014.<footnote id="fs-id1167662449485">Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. “2014 Sexually Transmitted Disease Surveillance,” 2015. http://www.cdc.gov/std/stats14/default.htm.</footnote> <link target-id="OSC_Microbio_23_03_RepInfTbl"/> summarizes bacterial infections of the reproductive tract.</para>

<item><emphasis effect="bold">Bacterial vaginosis</emphasis> is caused by an imbalance in the vaginal microbiota, with a decrease in lactobacilli and an increase in vaginal pH. <emphasis effect="italics">G. vaginalis</emphasis> is the most common cause of bacterial vaginosis, which is associated with vaginal discharge, odor, burning, and itching.</item>
<item><emphasis effect="bold">Gonorrhea</emphasis> is caused by <emphasis effect="italics">N. gonorrhoeae</emphasis>, which can cause infection of the reproductive and urinary tracts and is associated with symptoms of urethritis. If left untreated, it can progress to epididymitis, salpingitis, and pelvic inflammatory disease and enter the bloodstream to infect other sites in the body.</item>
<item><emphasis effect="bold">Chlamydia</emphasis> is the most commonly reported STI and is caused by <emphasis effect="italics">C. trachomatis</emphasis>. Most infections are asymptomatic, and infections that are not treated can spread to involve the epididymis of males and cause salpingitis and pelvic inflammatory disease in females.</item>
<item><emphasis effect="bold">Syphilis</emphasis> is caused by <emphasis effect="italics">T. pallidum</emphasis> and has three stages, primary, secondary, and tertiary. Primary syphilis is associated with a painless hard chancre lesion on genitalia. Secondary syphilis is associated with skin and mucous membrane lesions. Tertiary syphilis is the most serious and life-threatening, and can involve serious nervous system damage.</item>
<item><emphasis effect="bold">Chancroid</emphasis> is an infection of the reproductive tract caused by <emphasis effect="italics">H. ducreyi</emphasis> that results in the development of characteristic <emphasis effect="bold">soft chancres</emphasis>.</item>
